# Income and Taxation

When it comes to budgeting there are two sides

- Calculating income
- Forecasting spending

It's necessary to focus on net income, the income that comes after taxes and other deductions that have been made.

# Understanding Income Tax

As an employee, your deductions are automatically calculated taking into account

- PAYE
- National Insurance
- Pension
- Student Loans
- Any other deductions

## Deductions from your gross earnings

The two top payments that are taken from gross income is income tax and National Insurance Contributions (NICs)

Income tax is mandatory on almost all types of income including pensions. When it is collected through an employer it is often referred to as 'Pay As You Earn' (PAYE) tax. It is paid on income that is received by an individual within a given tax year (6th April in one year - 5th April of the next year ). For the years 2019/20, £12,500 is untaxed; this is called a 'personal allowance'. It typically goes up to match the rate of price inflation measured by the [Consumer Price Index(CPI)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/previousReleases).

This personal allowance has a ceiling of £100,000. Anything above this limit and up to £125,000 sees a decreased personal allowance. Anything above £125,000 has no personal allowance.

The types of income that are excluded from tax are:

- Gifts
- Lottery winnings
- Premium Bond winnings
- ISA earnings

## Income tax in England, Wales and Northern Island

If earning above the personal allowance in any tax year, it is mandatory to pay on the amount earned above it. There are three tax bands for different levels of income.

- Above £37,500 gross income incurs a 20% tax rate, known as basic-rate tax
- Between £50,000 and £150,000, gross income incurs a 40% tax rate, known as higher-rate tax
- Above £150,000 gross income incurs a 45% tax rate, known as additional-rate tax

## The economic impact of income tax

Income tax accounts for nearly one-third of the government's tax receipts. It is used to pay for government spendings such as the police, the NHS and the civil service.

Income tax rises in proportion to earnings as they rise. This is known as a progressive tax.

# Nation Insurance Contributions

The second important deduction from your gross income is National Insurance Contributions. National Insurance is paid by both you as an employee and by your employer(s).

Historically, National Insurance formed the basis for paying social security benefits related to unemployment, illness and retirement. First introduced in 1911, in the 1940s, the launch of the National Health Service and the expansion to state benefit schemes became encompassed in NICs.

Contributions from employers and employees make up close to a quarter of the government's tax receipts.

The way NI works is that HMRC issues each person in the UK with a National Insurance account number when they turn 16. Contributions to NI each year are recorded under this number.

The level of contributions and the number of years you’ve been paying NI influences entitlement to, and in some cases the level of, certain benefits. The state pension is a good case in point as it now requires you to have 35 years of NICs to get the full amount of state pension.

As with income tax, the rules and regulations surrounding National Insurance change regularly. In 2019/20 there was a lower income threshold of £8,632 per year and an upper earnings limit of £50,000. On income between these limits, employees’ National Insurance was generally levied at 12%. If you earned more than £50,000, you paid NICs at 2% above that.

These rates and bands were retained for 2020/21 except for the lower-income threshold which was raised to £9,500.

## Bands for Class 1 NICs in 2019/20 and 2020/21

| Rate | 2019/20          | 2020/21          |
| ---- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| 0%   | £0 – £8,632      | £0 – £9,500      |
| 12%  | £8,632 – £50,000 | £9,500 – £50,000 |
| 2%   | £50,000+         | £50,000+         |

# Calculating tax

For income of £56,000 in the tax year of 2019/20, someone what would someone pay in terms of income tax and NICs?

> Income from employment or pension: `£56,000`

> Minus Personal Allowance: `£12,500`

> Total taxable: `£56,000 - £12,500 = £43,500`

> Basic Rate Tax (20%): `£37,500 \* 0.2 = £7,500`

> Higher Rate Tax (40%): `£6,000 \* 0·4 = £2,400`

> Tax to be paid 2019/20: `£7,500 + £2,400 = £9,900`

> Threshold for paying NICs: `£8,632`

> NICs (12%): `((£50,000 - £8,632) / 100) \* 12 = £4,964.16`

> NICs (2%): `(£6000 / 100) \* 2 = £120`

> NICs to be paid 2019/20: `£4,964.16 + £120 = £5084.16`

> Net Income: `£56,000 - £5084.16 - £9,900 = £41015.84`

# Understanding Tax Codes

Understanding how income tax is deducted is important, but you also need to keep an eye on your tax code. This code tells your employer or pension provider how much income tax to deduct from your salary or pension. You can find your tax code on every payslip.

The code usually comprises four numbers and one or two letters – for example, 1250L.

The numbers define your tax-free personal allowance. 1250 with an extra zero is 12500, the personal allowance amount

The letter in the code defines the nature of your income. L is the most common letter in tax codes as it applies to most people who have just one job – be it full-time or part-time.

There are two tax forms that you will become familiar with in your working life:

- P60:

  - Annual statement of how much you’ve earned that tax year and how much you have paid in income tax and other deductions.
  - Received from an employer within two months of the end of each tax year (5 April).

- P45: the statement of income paid and tax deducted so far for the year when you leave a job (called the ‘prevailing tax year’).
  - Needs to be passed to the new employer so that they know what your tax code is, and how much tax you have already paid in the tax year.

## The Different Tax Codes

|  Code  | Explanation                                                                                                                                                        |
| :----: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   L    | Entitled to the standard tax-free personal allowance                                                                                                               |
|  M, N  | Additional marriage allowances some people are eligible for                                                                                                        |
|   K    | Income that is not taxed another way and is worth more than the tax-free allowances                                                                                |
|   T    | This code applies when the computation of tax due is made more complicated – for example by earning a very high income                                             |
|   0T   | <ul><li>Personal allowance has been used up</li><li>New job and no P45 from previous employer</li><li>Employer has insufficient details to give tax code</li></ul> |
|   BR   | All your income is taxed at the basic rate of tax                                                                                                                  |
|   D0   | All your income is taxed at the higher rate of income tax                                                                                                          |
|   D1   | All your income is taxed at the additional rate of tax                                                                                                             |
|   NT   | This code applies if you are paying no tax on your income. It applies to those in some categories of self-employment                                               |
| W1, M1 | Emergency tax codes (M1 monthly, W1 weekly). Tax is calculated on the income earned in that pay period, rather than yearly                                         |

Emergency tax codes are usually updated automatically after you have given your employer your P45 (see above). If you’re on an emergency tax code for more than a month or two after starting a new job, it’s best to contact HMRC and ask them to send your employer an updated tax code. You will always start a new tax year with the normal tax code, not an emergency one.

# Why Budget?

A budget helps in the following ways:

- Control spending by comparing income with spending
- Check you have enough income to pay for current and future bills without borrowing
- Shows spare income for saving or spending on treats/rewards
- Focus on better ways to spend money
- Plan spending goals and other targets like saving

# The Income Side of the Budget

Four issues should be considered when measuring the income side of budgeting:

- Record income in the relevant time period i.e. per month or annually.
- Include all sources of income
  - Paid employment
  - Self-employment
  - Savings
  - Investments
  - Pensions
  - Social Security benefits
  - Other forms of income such as selling items should be marked as 'Other' forms of income
- Where are the sources of income coming from?
- Budgeting solely or jointly?

To identify what counts as income and wealth, think of what you are assessing. If it comes in the form of cash that can be spent it is income. If it produces cash only after they can be sold, it is wealth.

# The Spending Side of the Budget

Spending can be broken down into three different categories:

- Essential
- Desirable (not essential but hard to go without)
- Non-essential

To give a better idea of what can be considered as falling into these categories, think about the following and they could be categorised:

| Item               | Categorisation                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Mobile Phone       | Essential                            |
| iPad/tablet        | Non-essential                        |
| Gym membership     | Non-essential/Desirable              |
| Eating out         | Non-essential                        |
| Streaming services | Non-Essential                        |
| Holiday            | Desirable/ Essential                 |
| Christmas presents | Desirable?                           |
| Phone insurance    | Essential? Desirable? Non-essential? |
| Daily Coffee       | Non-essential/ Desirable             |

# Building a Budget

Start with all income, including earnings from work, benefits, pensions and investments. If unsure about any income, it’s best not to include it.

Set out essential spending first:

- Mortgage repayments and rent
- Council tax
- Utility bills
- Essential insurance costs
- Food and drink
- Broadband
- Mobile phone bills

When that’s done, add up the essential spending items.

Now, focus on the desirable areas of spending. These are still items you’d expect to spend money on each year, however, it’s up to you how much you spend on these. Examples include:

- Clothing
- Holidays
- Memberships
- Meals out
- Birthday and Christmas presents

It’s also best to add a section for money set aside for a rainy day fund. This will help pay for any problems during the year. Add both the desirable spending and the essential spending

Compare your total income with your total spending.

If spending exceeds income:

- See where you can cut back to avoid having to borrow money, or you’ll need to draw on savings to cover the gap in income.
- Easiest to focus on cutting back the non-essentials
- Always check that you are getting the best deal you can on the essentials

If income exceeds spending:

- Use it to add money to your savings

While building a personal budget, consider the following key rules before starting.

- Ensure the time period is long enough to capture all income and spending. Working to just a weekly or monthly budget may miss spending on holidays, gifts or annual insurances
- Start budget with income before moving on to expenditure. Only include income that is certain or at least likely. This way, anything on top is a pleasant surprise
- Break down your spending as far as possible. This will show exactly where the cash is going
- Overestimate if unsure about what something may cost; underestimating will leave you with no budget to spare
- Divide your spending between ‘essential’, ‘desirable’ and non-essential’
- Add in an amount for unexpected spending (Rainy Day fund)
- It makes sense to have an annual budget, but also to break it down month by month.

The annual budget will present a high-level overview of finances and whether over the course of the year you are spending beyond your means.

The monthly budget will help you manage your day-to-day money, indicating if this is a month of heavy spending (e.g. December, with its Christmas spending for most people) or a month of light spending. Monthly snapshots will also highlight when it might be necessary to draw on savings to cover a month of heavy spending or place money in savings when the monthly spending is relatively low.

# Trimming on Spending

There are, many steps to trim spending and get a balance on the income.

Ways to cut back on spending:

- Paying some bills by direct debit may save you money
- Think about remortgaging if you’re currently on your lender’s standard variable rate, or your current deal is about to end
- Compare the market when renewing insurance. They often increase each year. Also, check that you’re not paying for any ‘extras’ you didn’t ask for or want
- If you’re paying high interest on your credit cards, look to see if you can transfer your balance to a new card at 0%
- Switch suppliers of gas, electricity, phone and broadband
- Consider getting a water meter, especially if you use low amounts, or there are fewer people living in your house than the number of bedrooms you have.
- If you’re paying for a gym and don’t go very often, see if you can do pay as you go instead
- Think about whether a branded item is really value for money or if you can live with buying a store’s own brand, or a non-branded item
- Cut down on the number of takeaway meals you have
- See if you can get a cheaper mobile tariff
- Buying in bulk for items such as contact lenses saves a lot of money
- Ditch your morning coffee from the local coffee shop
- Taking packed lunches to work can save £100s a year on lunch costs
- Buy fresh fruit and vegetables in season. Check whether a local market is cheaper than the supermarket
- Turn off lights, don’t leave appliances on stand-by and turn down the thermostat to save large amounts on energy bills
- Make a shopping list and stick to it rather than being tempted by items on the supermarket shelves
- Think carefully about buying extended warranties. They are usually poor value for money so it’s usually better simply to put aside some money in case of a problem.

If struggling to keep a lid on different aspects of spending, enforce more discipline through the ‘piggy banking’ technique. Set up a series of savings or bank accounts for each major category of spending – i.e. example holidays, socialising, clothing etc. Assign your income to each account in accordance with your budget plan. Keeping to the discipline of never spending more on each spending category than is in its assigned account, the overall budget will stay in balance.
