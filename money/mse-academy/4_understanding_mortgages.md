# Getting a mortgage: how much can I borrow?

Before making an offer to buy a property, It is important to know what terms and how much a lender will advance you. This gives you insight into what you can afford. Subsequently, you can counter with specific details of the property you wish to buy.

Before making a mortgage offer your lender will:

- Check your credit report to ensure the track record reflects a good investment especially if having previously borrowed money.

- Assess the amount of money they feel you can pay back (affordability test).

  - Aided by looking at bank statements (3 months worth)
    - This is usually to track your contractual spendings i.e. mobile phone, finance repayments etc
  - As a general rule, a lender can advance 4x the borrowers' salary

- Stress-test your finances
  - Factors that change your spending i.e. Mortgage interest rate going up

So ahead of talking to your lender, there are some things you should do to help present your best financial profile:

- Verify credit reports at each of the three credit rating agencies to make sure there is no incorrect information

- Make sure you provide both your income and your partner’s income details (if you are getting a joint mortgage).
  - Review your spending
    - Ideally at least three months before approaching your lender
    - Cut out some non-essential regular spending
- Consider using a mortgage advisor (also known as a broker) to help with your application for your choice of mortgage.

  - An advisor’s expertise can help – particularly if you are a first-time buyer.
  - Check that their advice covers the whole mortgage market
  - Check the fee payable – typically this is around £500 or a small percentage (less than 1%) of the sum you want to borrow.

- Know your job status influences a lender’s decision. Lenders are wary about lending to borrowers who are on a temporary contract or in a probationary period for a permanent contract. A mortgage broker will be able to help you find lenders who are more willing to lend in these circumstances.

- Think about the term of the mortgage. Typically, the first time people take out a mortgage they set a 25 year repayment term.

  - It is possible to borrow for longer though.
    - Repayments are lower, as you’re paying less each year
    - However, the total amount you eventually pay in interest will be higher, as you’re borrowing for a much longer period.
      - A longer-term may stretch into your planned retirement at which point you are likely to have a lower income to cover mortgage repayments.

- Make sure you are aware of the costs involved in completing the purchase of your property – like legal and removal costs, as well as any fees payable to secure a mortgage.

# The property in question and the importance of ‘loan-to-value’

In addition to undertaking the credit, affordability and stress tests, your lender will want details of the property you want to buy. The reasons behind this are that a mortgage is a secured method of loaning money. Meaning that if the borrower fails to make the required mortgage repayments, the bank can repossess the property and sell it on to recover the original amount lent

Three things your lender will want to know about the property are:

- Are you buying a freehold or leasehold property? The difference being that leaseholders do not own the land on which their property is built and only own the property for the term of the lease. Many lenders are unwilling to lend on leasehold properties, particularly where the term of the lease is short (80 years or less). Such properties may become difficult to sell unless the lease is extended.

- Are you buying a property to live in (your ‘prime’ residence) or to rent out (‘buy-to-let’)? For the latter, lenders will usually charge a higher mortgage rate.

- Is there anything about the property that could make it risky to provide a mortgage for? For example, is it a very old property, or does it have an unusual construction (e.g. built with straw rather than bricks)? Is the property in an unusual location (e.g. above a shop, which may result in issues about access and responsibilities for maintenance)?

Before agreeing to a mortgage, the lender will get a valuation of the property you want to buy. For most lenders, the maximum mortgage they will provide is 95% of the property’s value – or 95% ‘loan-to-value’ (LTV). This is provided that the size of this mortgage does not exceed the maximum the lender is prepared to advance you under the affordability test.

So, for a property costing £200,000, a 95% LTV mortgage would enable you to borrow £190,000 (£200,000 x 95%) leaving you to provide the other £10,000.

Since lenders tend not to provide 100% LTV mortgages, there is usually a need to use other funds to supplement the mortgage to meet the agreed price for purchasing the property. For first-time buyers, these could come from using the proceeds from a Help-to-Buy ISA or a Lifetime ISA (LISA).

## Repayment or interest-only

The first major choice to be made about a mortgage is how to repay it. The options are a ‘repayment’ mortgage or an ‘interest-only’ mortgage. These days many lenders only offer the former, making the decision simple!

With a repayment mortgage, the original amount of debt is paid off in stages throughout the life of the loan. The typical structure is a reducing balance loan with a set amount paid each month throughout the mortgage term unless the interest rate changes. The table below exemplifies this pattern

### Annual payments on a repayment mortgage (£)

| In year | Interest paid | Capital repaid | Total mortgage payment |
| ------- | ------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1       | 3957          | 2379           | 6336                   |
| 5       | 3546          | 2790           | 6336                   |
| 10      | 2930          | 3406           | 6336                   |
| 15      | 2177          | 4159           | 6336                   |
| 20      | 1412          | 4924           | 6336                   |
| 25      | 142           | 6194           | 6336                   |

Initially, the majority of annual mortgage repayments are made up of interest, as there’s a large sum to pay interest on. Only a small proportion of repayments go towards paying off the capital. Getting closer to the end of the mortgage term, repayments mostly go towards paying off the capital, as there’s then a much smaller loan, which accrues much less interest.

One consequence is that on earlier repayment, a borrower might be surprised at how much of the original amount remains. The table above shows a £100,000 repayment mortgage payable over 25 years, at a mortgage rate of 4%.

For an interest-only mortgage:

- The original amount is unchanged throughout the life of the loan. Only interest is paid off
- At the end of the loan period, the borrower has to pay the original amount off in full. This is typically done with savings or an investment scheme (ISA, unit trusts).

An investment scheme can be seen as risky it builds insufficient funds to repay the mortgage.

## Fixed-rate or variable rate?

It is now time to decide between your mortgage – should you go for a fixed-rate or a variable rate mortgage product? Over the typical 25-year life of a mortgage, this is a decision you may choose to make several times, switching from fixed-rate to variable or vice versa as you seek out the product that is best for you each time.

Understanding the way interest rates are set can be done by exploring the most popular types of mortgage products currently available.

### Fixed-Rate Mortgages

The rate at which interest is charged for the life of loan does not change regardless of any changes in the interest rate that is set by the Bank of England. This product is popular with borrowers who need to account for the costs of the mortgage in their budgeting.

The downsides to this product are:

- If bank rates fall below the fixed-rate, there is no benefit reflected on the product; the rate will stay the same

  - Flipping this situation, a fixed rate will protect a borrower from any rises in interest rate

- They come with early repayment charges, which is mandatory. This also applies when moving on to a new deal.

- When the fixed-rate term comes to an end, the rate typically reverts to the lender Standard Variable Rate, or SVR, which may be much higher than the fixed rate that is terminated.

### Variable Rate Mortgages

There are three types of variable-rate mortgages, Trackers, Discount Mortgages and Standard Variable Rate Mortgages.

#### Standard Variable Rate Mortgage

This is a product that isn't usually a choice but acts as a default when a previous mortgage deal comes to an end.

- It is set at the discretion of the lender. It can move up and down in line with when the Bank of England changes the bank rate. This is not an obligation, however.

  - As an example, the bank rate could rise by 0.25% and a lender's SVR could rise by 0.35%.

### Trackers

This is the product that is typically seen when looking for a mortgage. This rate is contractually linked to a major interest rate i.e. Bank of England

- As an example, the tracker rate could be the bank rate plus 1%. It will move up and down in line with the bank rate.

- The deals tend to last between 2 and 5 years, you can get lifetime trackers.
- These don't have early repayment fees, making it easy to switch to new deals without having to wait for the tracker deal to end.

### Discount Mortgages

This product usually offers a discount off a lender's Standard Variable Rate. Once the SVR raises, the discount lessens and repayments are higher

- Usually over a short period but can go for longer
- Has early repayment fees if within the initial discount period

It is important to clarify what you are getting. If it says 1.5% discount, find out if 1.5% is the rate paid or it is the discount on the lender's SVR.

Variable-rate mortgage products tend to be good when the bank rate is falling or low and stable. By contrast, they are not good for borrowers when bank rate rises since the mortgage rate will rise, thereby increasing the monthly cost of the mortgage to the borrower.

However, the more you require certainty over what you pay, the more you should think about going for a fixed-rate mortgage. There’s plenty to think about when choosing a mortgage product, and specifically its interest rate characteristics.

# Mortgage choices: offset, flexible and portable mortgages

The pros and cons of fixed-rate and variable-rate mortgages have been covered. But a lender is likely to offer some further choices about your mortgage product. These can, in a sense, customise your mortgage to meet your financial circumstances and even your lifestyle.

### Offset mortgages

By moving surplus cash to the mortgage lender, this is deducted from the total amount owed before the monthly mortgage interest is worked out. If the interest rate is lower on than that charged on the mortgage, this can be a good deal as those savings are earning interest at the mortgage rate. The positives to this are that the savings can be withdrawn and used. Of course, the interest rate charged on the mortgage goes up as you offset less of the debt.

- The interest rate is usually a little bit higher than other lenders would charge
- Dependant on how much of the debt is offset by savings

### Flexible mortgages

A deal where monthly payment amounts can vary and even borrow back money already paid off. This provides the ability to pay off early and also cover any tough financial times. Most mortgages allow you to pay off the extra. That means you pay off your mortgage faster and pay less interest in total. However, some people worry that, with the freedom to reduce payments in bad times, they won’t push their payments back up enough in the good times. Like when you’re on holiday, you don’t want to go back to work. With a fixed or variable rate mortgage, you pay whatever the lender tells you to pay each month - and that inflexibility is sometimes helpful if you want to be disciplined about repaying.

### Portable mortgages

If you sell up and move to a new property that you are buying you can take your existing mortgage to finance the new purchase.

- You may need a top-up of an additional mortgage to meet the asking price.

If a mortgage is not portable you would have to repay the existing mortgage on your current property and obtain an entirely new mortgage to enable you to complete on your new home – which may mean you need to pay the early repayment charge to get out of the mortgage.

# Managing your mortgage: Overpaying

If you have spare income each month, compare the mortgage rate and interest rate you could get if, instead of overpaying, that income is placed into a savings account. If the mortgage rate is higher, it makes sense to pay down the mortgage than to save the money as the savings product offers less in return

There are, though, a few things to be aware of before opting to overpay:

- Does your mortgage contract allow overpayments, if so, by how much?

  - 10% of the balance per year is a standard figure. Exceeding any limits for overpayments may incur early repayment charges, particularly if you’re on a fixed-rate or discount mortgage.

- If you do use your savings to make an overpayment, check for any withdrawal charges on your account.

- Do you have other debts (e.g. a bank loan) with a higher interest rate than the mortgage rate you are paying? If so, using your savings to reduce or pay off these debts would make more sense than reducing your mortgage balance.

### Scenarios

Your mortgage has three years left before you complete repayments. The mortgage rate is 3.2% per annum but you earn 1.8% per annum on your savings in a fixed-rate ISA account. If you withdraw money from the bond account before maturity, you pay a charge of 6 months interest. Would it be worth using the money from a bond account to overpay on the mortgage?

The following calculation does not take into account other considerations such as compounding interest from previous years and has ideal conditions such as money to fall back on.

> Let's calculate the potential loss of earnings on the fixed-rate ISA. For the full year, we lose 1.8%. We lose an additional 0.9% (1.8 / 2) for withdrawing before maturity. However, we can spread this 0.9% over the three years of the mortgage as 0.3% (0.9% / 3). So in the first year, we lose 2.1% (1.8 + 0.3) as opposed to the 3.2% of interest saved by reducing the mortgage.

Even if the maths points to overpaying your mortgage, should you use all your savings to reduce your mortgage balance?

> This is unwise unless the mortgage deal has a borrow back feature. Putting all of one's savings into one pot leaves the rest of life's uncertainties uncovered

## Moving to another Deal

Around 4 / 10 mortgage transactions relate to people remortgaging their existing property without moving home at the same time. Moving home is very likely to trigger a new mortgage deal as well – certainly when the existing mortgage is not portable from one property to another. But it is the volume of remortgages which highlights the fact that periodically it makes sense to switch to a new mortgage deal, and maybe a new lender too.

One trigger point for remortgaging is when the initial mortgage deal comes to an end.
If the borrower takes no action, the mortgage rate defaults to the lender's SVR.
SVR mortgages tend to be expensive – certainly, when compared with fixed, discount or ‘tracker’ rate mortgages, the borrower needs to take action to find something better.

A mortgage should not be seen as a product you have to stick with until it comes to term and the money repaid to the lender. Since it represents to many households the largest regular monthly outgoing, every opportunity should be made to switch to a new deal if it makes financial sense. Since interest rates do change over time, opportunities are likely to arise to cut the cost of your mortgage.

## Ditching a fixed-rate mortgage

Another trigger for remortgaging that arises under certain interest rate conditions is when making an early repayment of an existing fixed-rate deal and moving to a new mortgage makes financial sense.

To assess whether it makes financial sense use the following metrics:

- The cost of getting out of your current mortgage deal
- The additional costs of the new deal (arrangement fees, legal costs etc)
- Comparing the costs with the savings expected to be made by moving to a new product with a lower mortgage rate

In a period of falling interest rates, repaying a fixed-rate mortgage and moving to one with a lower rate can make sound financial sense.

#### Scenario 1

The Sharp family have 3 years left on a 5-year fixed-rate (interest-only) mortgage of £100,000.

The current mortgage rate is 6% per annum but they could move to a new 3-year fixed-rate mortgage at 4% per annum. To do this they have to pay an early repayment charge of 3% of the amount outstanding and also pay an arrangement fee of £500 for the new mortgage.

Assume the savings product has a fixed 2% rate of interest.

What should the Sharps do?

The costs of moving to the new product are:

> The early repayment charge: `£100,000 \* 0.03 = £3,000`

> The arrangement fee: `£500`

> Total: `£3,000 + £500 = £3,500`

> New Deal savings: `(£100,000 \* 0.02) \* 3 = £6,000`

> Net savings: `£6,000 - £3500 = £2500`

To pay for the costs they use their savings equalling the total of the charges

> Savings product losses: `(£3500 \* 0.02) \* 3 = £210`

So, the Sharps should move to the new fixed-rate deal.

#### Scenario 2

This time the existing fixed rate is running at 4% per annum and has two years left.

The interest-only mortgage is for £100,000.

A new 2-year fixed-rate mortgage can be secured at 2% per annum.

The arrangement fee is £750 and the early repayment charge is 2% of the amount outstanding.

Assume the savings product has a fixed 2% rate of interest.

> The Early repayment charge: `£100,000 \* 0.02 = £2000`

> The arrangement fee: `£750`

> Total: `£2000 + £750 = £2750`

> New deal savings: `(£100,000 \* 0.02) \* 2 = £4,000`

> Net Savings: `£4,000 - £ 2750 = £1,250`

To pay for the costs they use their savings equalling the total of the charges

> Savings Product losses: `(£2750 \* 0.02) \* 3 = £110`

It still makes financial sense to move to the new product as the loss in savings is outweighed by the savings made by switching to the new deal.

# The other costs of buying a property

It’s not just about getting the mortgage and being able to pay it. There are several costs that you will additionally incur as you take ownership of your new home.

To show you how these costs may add up, let’s suppose you’re buying a property for £220,000.

What costs do you incur if you are not a first-time buyer and the property is to be your home?

> Mortgage arrangement fee (common with discount and fixed-rate mortgages and some other products): say £500.

> Legal costs including local searches and Land Registry fee: £800.

> Survey and valuation: £350.

> Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT): £1,900.

> Removal costs: say £700.

> GRAND TOTAL: £4,250.

There may also be a fee to the mortgage broker if you’ve used one to help choose and organise the mortgage. Some costs arising from getting a mortgage – specifically the arrangement fee – can, subject to the lender’s approval, be added to the mortgage. The other costs will, though, have to be met upfront.

Other transaction costs involved in property transactions are the fees payable to an estate agent (if one is used) and the charge for an Energy Performance Certificate in respect of the property. These costs are, though, met by the property seller rather than the buyer.

#### Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT)

The marginal rates of Stamp Duty Land Tax on a residential property purchase in England and Northern Ireland in 2020/21 were:

> up to £125,000, 0%

> £125,001 to £250,000, 2%

> £250,001 to £925,000, 5%

> £925,001 to £1.5 million, 10%

> above £1.5 million, 12%.

Note that first-time buyers are exempt from SDLT for properties up to £300,000 and at a reduced rate of 5% for the amount above £300,000 up to a maximum of £500,000. Purchases above £500,000 do not qualify for any SDLT relief. Also, note that a surcharge of 3% applies if the property is not acquired as a ‘prime residence’.

# Mortgages: understanding and managing the risks

Some risks arise from homeownership and having a mortgage. Even if action can not be taken, being better prepared to handle the consequences of them is necessary.

Mortgages are secured loans, so there is the risk of losing your home (via repossession by the lender) if you default on repayments.

In recent years, mortgages have been very affordable due to the historic low levels of interest rates. Future years will inevitably see higher interest rates return. Mortgage lenders are required by their regulators to work with borrowers who get into financial trouble with their mortgages. They can eventually repossess the property of a defaulter if it doesn’t get resolved.

The reality is that house prices fluctuate over periods. Finding yourself in negative equity (where the market value of your property is less than the remaining mortgage on it) if you buy at times just before one of those periodic falls in property prices. Provided you can still afford to meet your mortgage repayments, being in negative equity by itself is not a problem, though, unless you have to move home. In these circumstances, you may need to find the difference between the market value of your property and the mortgage amount you have to repay.

Those who obtained mortgages under old affordability testing rules cannot obtain the same size of mortgage under the rules that have applied since 2014. These people are at risk of being ‘mortgage prisoners’, unable to take advantage of better mortgage deals as it means submitting themselves for a re-appraisal of the size of mortgage they can afford.

Interest rate risk is pervasive for all mortgages
– you may lose out by taking a fixed-rate deal only for interest rates to fall.

- Or you take out a variable rate deal and interest rates rise.

And there is always the risk of inertia

- Not taking action when your initial mortgage deal ends and you default to a high rate SVR.

The other risk is not looking ahead and planning for life’s uncertainties

- Events which will affect your household budget and put pressure on your ability to make your mortgage repayments.
  - Breaks in employment
  - Marital breakdown
  - Illness
  - Unexpected repair bills on your property.

By knowing the risks, you can effectively plan to mitigate the consequences should they arise.
