# 1. Saving and Later Life

To gain a good understanding of how much income you retire requires a good estimate of how much you will be spending. It’s possible to plan this as we can assume that the pension income and prices of goods and service will rise in line with price inflation.

Most people in relationships opt for forecasting spending for the household as opposed to individual planning. The advantage of a retirement plan based on the individual is that each member of the household has their own pension arrangements, which they keep even if the make-up of their household changes.

- Children growing up.
- Family members move away.

To estimate spending in retirement, we can inspect our own or the household’s current pattern of spending. Remember that spending now will certainly differ in some ways to spending when retired.

- By retirement, most homeowners will have finished paying off any mortgage, so the amount that these pensioners spend on housing may fall.
- Pensioners often spend more time at home, so bills for gas and electricity could rise.
- There will be savings on work-related costs such as pension contributions and commuting.
- There may be an increase in travel to see friends and relatives, but pensioners often qualify for reduced-rate or free travel.
- Pensioners may spend more on holidays, but may save money by going away at off-peak times.

In later retirement, pensioners may have to spend more on health-related items such as help with personal care.

# 2. State Pensions

Limited state retirement pensions were first paid in the UK in 1908. Improved in the 1946 National Insurance Act which brought in flat-rate universal state pensions, these took effect in 1948.

The UK government plans staged rises in the age at which people can receive their state pension, to reach 67 years in 2028 and 68 years in the mid-2030s, with further increases probable. One of the aims of this strategy is to ensure that no more than one third of adult life consists of retirement. The longer the population lives on average, the higher will be the state pension age.

## 2.1 Schemes

### 2.1.1 The Old Scheme (pre-April 2016)

This scheme comes in two forms:

- The basic state pension which pays a flat rate (in 2020/21, £134.25 per week for a single person). Those not entitled to the ‘basic’ pension, or receive less than the full amount, may get an £80.45 top up subject to their spouse’s NICs record.

- The second state pension. Restricted mainly to employees. First introduced in 1978, when it went by the name State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (SERPS).

### 2.1.2 The new scheme (from April 2016)

From April 2016, for those reaching the state pension age (SPA) the state basic and second pensions are both replaced by a single flat-rate pension (in 2020/21, £175.20 per week for a single person).

Entitlement to the state pension depends on paying, or receiving credit of, National Insurance Contributions (NICs) paid by employees and the self-employed during working life.

The additional state pension, is typically replaced by a workplace or personal pension scheme for most people, effectively ‘contracting’ most people out of this pension.

People who reached state pension age before 6 April 2010 needed to have National Insurance Contributions (NICs) covering about nine-tenths of their working life to get the full ‘old’ basic state pension. This was subsequently changed to a 30-year contribution record.

For the ‘new’ state pension the required contribution record for the full amount is 35 years. You get a reduced pension if you have a shorter record of paying NICs. You must provide contributions for at least 10 years to take advantage of this.

One choice those approaching state pension age have is to defer the date at which they start to receive the pension. For every nine weeks of deferral the amount of state pension paid rises by 1%. This may be an attractive option for those planning to carry on working beyond their state pension age.

# 2.2 How Far Does the State Pension Go?

In 2020/21, the UK government’s assessment of the smallest weekly income required by pensioners is £173.75 for a single person and £265.20 for a couple (whether married or not). For a single pensioner, the ‘old’ state pension in 2019/20 is, at the most, three-quarters of the income deemed to be necessary for a pensioner. Anyone relying solely on the ‘old’ state pension will need to claim a means-tested top up. Means-tested retirement benefits can discourage saving for retirement because building up a small private pension reduces the amount of benefits you can claim.

The change to a flat-rate pension from April 2016, which is higher than the state basic pension under the ‘old’ scheme, intends to ensure that fewer state pensioners fall short of the income they need. As a result, fewer pensioners need to claim means-tested benefits and there will be less of a disincentive to saving for retirement.

If those on a state pension do find that their income is less than the standards set out above, then the recourse is to claim pension credit. Large numbers of people entitled to pension credit do not claim it, with the result that they lose out on the extra income it provides, as well as access to other state benefits that come with it.

Even if you get the full ‘flat-rate’ state pension this amounts to an annual income of £9,110. This is not enough for a comfortable retirement.

Hopefully you will have an occupational or personal pension plan to add to what the state will provide. You will start to look at these next, starting with occupational schemes.

# 3. Occupational Pension Schemes

These are schemes that offered by your place your employer. There are two types of occupational schemes:

**Defined Contribution Schemes**

- What you receive from the schemed depends upon the size of the pension fund you accumulate

**Defined Benefit Schemes**

- New joiners typically do not receive this option as it’s an expensive scheme to run

- Linked to your salary, either your last working year before retirement or your average salary across the life of the scheme.

If you are starting a pension now its probable that defined contribution scheme will be the one you’ll have to go for. In fact, membership of such schemes has increased in recent years, as a result of the closure to new membership of defined benefit schemes and the policy of ‘automatic enrolment’ onto pension schemes.

## 3.1 Moving to Average Salary Pensions

Defined benefit schemes are shifting from ‘final salary’ schemes to the ‘average salary’ scheme. This scheme applies strongly to public sector workers.

## 3.2 They Work Like a Pay Rise

All employers now must automatically enrol their eligible employees, those aged 22 years or older and who earn at least £10,000 per annum, onto a workplace pension scheme.

Employees must take action if they do not wish to be a part of the workplace pension scheme offered by their employers. Automatic enrolment has resulted in a sizeable increase in participation in pension schemes — this rose from 47% of employees in 2012 when automatic enrolment started to 73% in 2017.

A big benefit of a workplace pension is that the employer has to contribute to the pension. Under auto enrolment, the employer must contribute at least 3% of your salary (within certain limits), which is a bit like a pay rise.

You get income tax relief on your contributions to your pension. This applies to defined benefit as well as defined contribution (or money purchase) schemes.

# 4. Personal Pensions

A money purchase scheme is simple in one sense. It’s a pot of cash you build up over the years, made up of contributions into the pension and hopefully some investment growth on top. Any charges levied by the pension provider will automatically be withdrawn from the pot.

You will need to arrange a personal pension yourself. The tricky bit is where to find a suitable pension with low charges that gives you the flexibility and features you desire.

Its worth getting financial advice. You may find an adviser through word of mouth or online, but beware taking guidance from a bank as staff might try to sell you that bank’s products.

## 4.1 Costs and Risks

With a personal pension you will need to decide how much you pay into your fund. It’s important to get this decision right because if you pay in too little, your pension will be too small. Pay in too much, and you could limit your current spending and standard of living, but you can’t be certain of the correct amount. But a basic principle is to put in as much as you can afford and start as early as possible.

Also remember that saving into a pension is one form of retirement savings, and other methods may yield big gains.

**How Much to Pay In?**

Take the age you start your pension and halve it. Then put this percentage of your pre-tax salary into your pension each year until you retire.

Someone starting aged 32 should contribute 16% of their salary for the rest of their working life under this ‘rule’. While 16% of your pay may seem a big commitment, this figure includes your employer’s contribution.

The aim is that the pension, when it starts, will provide a regular income, paid monthly, until death.

**The Costs …**

When investing for the long term, what also counts is the investment return after deducting all the charges. An investment fund that offers the chance of higher returns but has high charges might be a poor choice compared with a less ambitious investment fund with modest charges.

Also consider inflation as rising prices reduce the buying power of money. To protect against this, you would need to invest extra money to compensate for the effect of inflation, both over the years when the savings are building up and once the pension starts.

**Where is the money invested?**

You can choose to actively manage how you invest your money in some types of pension, such as a SIPP (self-invested personal pension) or allow the pension provider to choose where to invest it, based on your attitude to risk. Some workplace pensions go a step further and have a default fund that tends to be medium risk, so you don’t have to make any choices.

**… and The Risks**

Defined contribution schemes lead to individuals shouldering the risks up to the time when the pension starts. This means that different people saving the same amount can receive different pensions, and a person’s pension can be markedly different depending on when they retire.

# 5. Understanding Pensions Tax Allowances

**You Get Tax Relief on Your Contributions**

You get income tax relief on the contributions, up to an annual limit set by the government.

- The government tops up your pension
  - If you are a basic rate tax-payer and you put £80 into your pension, £100 will be there in total. That’s because if you earn £100 you’ll see £80 of it after tax, so the government puts the £20 difference in your pot.

For most people, all tax relief will be at the 20% level, but if you are a higher or top rate taxpayer, you receive extra tax relief up to the level of the tax rate you pay, be that 40% or 45%. You may need to claim that extra money back from HMRC if your occupational scheme is not already set up to automatically take the full relief.

Some occupational schemes also let you claim National Insurance relief via ‘salary sacrifice’, and these are automatically set up to give employees their full tax relief entitlement whatever tax band they are in. Here, your employer will put aside the portion of your salary you want to put in a pension, and deposit it for you from your pre-tax earnings so it never gets taxed nor does any National Insurance get taken off.

**The Annual Tax Relief Allowance**

You can get income tax relief on all contributions you make as long as you do not pay in more than £40,000 per year or the value of your annual salary, whichever is lower. If you exceed either of those totals you still get tax relief up to that amount but not on anything above.

If you earn more than £150,000 a year your annual limit will fall. The following three years allows for you to roll forward any unused relief.

You do not get relief on the contributions your employer makes in an occupational scheme.

**The Lifetime Tax Allowance**

A lifetime allowance (LTA) exists for the total of all your personal pension funds, £1,055,000 (2020). To work out your total in a pension for LTA purposes, add the value of your pension pot(s) together.

For defined benefit schemes, you calculate the total value by multiplying your expected annual pension by 20 plus any tax-free cash lump sum if its on top of the pension.

If the amount you take out of a pension exceeds this total, the excess is subject to extra tax. Lump sum withdrawals incur a 55% tax rate. Income withdrawals incur a 25% tax rate on top of the normal rate.

It’s advisable to seek financial advice when making important decisions about your pension.

# 6. Pension and Retirement

You can withdraw up to 25% of your pensions at the age of 55 without incurring any tax charge.

People retiring with defined contribution scheme pensions before April 2015 had little to no options other than to convert their remaining pension funds into an annuity. This is where you give your pot to an insurance company and in return you get an income for the rest of your life.

In effect, this is insurance against living for longer than your pension pot would otherwise last. The annuity provider will take a slice of the pension pot in charges before converting the remaining amount to income.

In April 2015, the options for using accumulated pension funds available to those on defined contribution schemes changed radically as a result of new government legislation, and you now have more freedom

# 7. Pension Revolution (Freeing Up Access to Pensions Pots)

In his 2014 Budget Statement, George Osborne, unveiled proposals for pensions reform which have changed the financial options for those approaching retirement. These proposals took effect from April 2015 and have led to easing the restrictions on access to pension pots.

The 2014 Taxation of Pensions Act provides greater freedom for those on ‘defined contribution’ schemes aged 55 years or more to access their personal pension pots:

- You can access the funds as cash to do what you want with, say, to invest in a range of assets (such as property) or to pay off a mortgage or other debts, or to finance current consumption. 25% of the funds accessed from the fund is tax-free. The rest is taxable as income and so could attract tax of up to 45% (for taxable income above £150,000).
- You can leave the money invested and draw down at a later date.
- There is also greater flexibility to pass on a pension to dependants after death.
  - For those who die before the age of 75, within a two-year grace period, can pass on their pension to any beneficiaries tax-free.

One key thing to remember whatever option you choose is that pension income is liable to income tax. The good news, though, is that National Insurance Contributions (NICs) are not payable.

Whilst welcoming the greater flexibility that these reforms provide for pensioners, there are some concerns:

- It implies that annuities are poor value and that there are better ways to invest pensions funds.

  - It’s unfair to slate all annuity products as poor value as it’s a reflection of growing longevity and also the current low interest rates.

- Some pensioners may find themselves short on income needed for a comfortable retirement if they do not choose to invest the funds.

- The pensions’ industry does not have the resource to deal with the new advice surrounding these wider freedoms

# 8. Pension Shortfalls

Reviewing your position is essential for anyone with a defined contribution pension scheme because stock market performance is unpredictable, and the pension pot may not build up at the rate that was originally assumed. Most pension schemes and plans issue statements yearly. This enables you to check how your pension is building up.

Ideally the comparison of spending in retirement versus pension income needs refining against an annual budget.

**What are Your Options?**

If you are still some decades away from retirement, the first option you should look at is to increase your contributions to your pension scheme. Making extra voluntary contributions is available under occupational schemes. With personal schemes it’s your choice about how much you want to contribute. If you are an income taxpayer, you will benefit from the tax relief on contributions up to the annual limit set by the government.

If you are close to retirement, it still makes sense to consider topping up your pension fund, provided you do not exceed the lifetime limit for pension funds set by the government.

When you are close to retirement there is room to build up your fund and with it the size of your eventual pension income.

- Cut spending.

  - Can you cut your bills by switching to cheaper providers?
  - Could you forego certain of the activities you were planning for retirement?

- Defer retirement and work for a little longer.

  - A benefit of working beyond state retirement age is that National Insurance Contributions (NICs) are no longer payable regardless of your earnings.

- Draw on savings.
-
- Draw on your pension lump sum.

- Make use of other assets by selling them.

  - There is also the use of equity release products.

- One final idea for making cash from your home is to rent out a room to a lodger
  - Tax-free up to £7500 a year for an individual or up to £3750 a year each for a couple, under the so-called ‘rent-a-room’ scheme.
