# 1. Money Mantras

When you’re low on money, you have to ask yourself the following questions:

- Do I need it?
- Can I afford it?
- Have I checked if it’s cheaper elsewhere?

If you answer any of these questions with a no, you should not buy it.

If you have the money, you should still question whether it’s a wise purchase or not:

- Will I use it?
- Is it worth it?
- Have I checked it’s cheaper elsewhere?

# 2. Financial Personality

**Do You Consider Yourself to Be a Risk-Taker or Risk-Averse With Money?**

The majority of people consider themselves to be risk-averse. Perhaps this is because they would rather keep what they have rather than risk losing it all in the search of higher gain.

**Are You More of a Spender or More of a Saver?**

This speaks more to your financial circumstances rather than your aspirations. Often people who would like to save more money do not have spare income to do so. Those who have money find it easier to save.

**Do You Actively Budget for You And/Or Your Household?**

By creating a basic budget, you map out your spending against your income and can actively avoid getting into financial difficulties.

**Do You Check Your Bank and Credit Card Accounts?**

You need to do this to make sure there are no wrong or fraudulent transactions. Know when you’re close to your credit limit and when you need to repay, managing your accounts supports your budgeting too. Letting you know how much is in the bank and when you have to pay bills.

**When It Comes to Suppliers, Do You Switch or Stay?**

Switchers end up with better deals than stayers in the general rule. Stayers tend to get overcharged for provided services.

**Are You Always Looking for a Better Deal?**

Scanning the markets and switching to cheaper, meaningful deals is good news for finances

**How Far Ahead Do You Plan Your Finances?**

Planning as far as possible involves estimations about your income and expenses/ spending. Plan for up to a year ahead if possible. Month to month may leave you in a situation where you are always worrying about money. Month to month management may encourage inefficient decision-making. e.g. monthly payment options for a service such as car insurance

**Do You Solely or Jointly Manage Money?**

This depends on circumstance; living alone gives you sole responsibility of all money going in and out. Relationships or cohabiting will require some decisions to made jointly and also pooling financial resources together. Whatever the situation, it’s best to coordinate finances to some degree so that everyone’s able to pay their share.

# 3. Social Influences on Spending

Spending is not solely based on the price of something, social pressures are a common influence. To understand this, a brief look at the concept of social status.

[Max Weber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weber), states that:

> ’Authority or prestige perceived by others defines the level of a person’s social status’

Whilst a person’s job or income level reflects social standing, so does the features of what goods and services they buy.

[Zygmunt Bauman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygmunt_Bauman), states that:

> ’One needs to be a consumer first before one can think of becoming anything particular’.

What we consume defines our identity, as fashion and trends change so do out identities. This, in turn, can put pressure on a person’s finances as they try to keep up with those trends

In a consumer society, goods and services may also act as status symbols. The latest smartphone or car acts as motivation for spending. This is down to concern about what others think, based on what a person consumes and owns. This is also known as symbolic consumption.

[Thorstein Veblen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorstein_Veblen), talked about how spending is a way of displaying wealth. Examples of displaying wealth are buying designer clothing or a Ferrari, these are symbols of wealth. Referred to as ’conspicuous consumption’.

[Pierre Bordieau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Bourdieu) offers a different view to Veblen. Consumption is a way of distinguishing people by social class. In other words, people buy and spend according to the social class they aspire/believe to be in. This extends beyond social class, social groupings may also influence how and where we spend our money.

Examples of social groups:

- Punk
- Goth
- Hipster
- Environmentalist
- Intellectual
- ’social influencer’

The previous quotes have given rise to modern views on consumption as trends have changed:

[Silvia Bellezza](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/cbs-directory/detail/sb3761) observes that being busy (and by implication successful) at work is a form of status symbol. Conspicuous consumption here is time. Early writers denoted that a sign of wealth is having large amounts of leisure time as opposed to working.

[Elizabeth Currid-Halkett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Currid-Halkett), offers a contrasting standpoint; ’inconspicuous consumption’ is consumption that reflects cultural standing as opposed to the ownership of material goods. e.g. education, organic food, practising yoga. This is further supported by [Giana Eckhardt](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/giana-m-eckhardt%28828bedca-f681-4cc3-aae7-df3162cbd608%29.html) who claims that the wealthy distinguish themselves with more subtle and less obvious branding such as smaller logos on clothing.

Viewpoints aside, spending, in some part, reflects your social background, influences and aspirations.

# 4. Habits and Impairment of Spending Choices

## 4.1 The Preference for Bringing Forward Financial Rewards and for Delaying Outlays

[Evidence](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/bills/article-2383414/Money-Advice-Service-More-half-adults-struggling-bills-debt.html) suggests that, given the choice, 1/5 of people would prefer to accept less money now as opposed to more money later.

This preference also means that people prefer to delay payment rather than make them straight away. Delaying payments leads to poor decision-making when paying for goods. A perfect example of this is paying monthly instalments on car insurance as opposed to in full. Given that the interest rate charged is high, you end up paying a significant amount more monthly.

## 4.2 The Preference for Simplicity Over Best Value

**Case Study**

You are buying an appliance at £100. You need to borrow money to buy it and have the following choices for loans. Which loan option would you choose?

- Loan 1: Pay £120 back at the end of the year.
- Loan 2: Pay £115 back at the end of the year.
- Loan 3: Pay a £10 arrangement fee, then equal monthly repayments with a 5% interest rate p.a.
- Loan 4: Pay a £5 arrangement fee, then equal monthly repayments with an 8% interest rate p.a.
- Loan 5: Pay equal monthly repayments with a 7% interest rate p.a. plus a final £3 charge.

It may be surprising, but Loan 5 is the cheapest option. The terms used can be confusing and because of that, people tend to go for simplicity.

- Loan 1 costs £120.
- Loan 2 costs £115.
- Loan 3 costs £113.04.
- Loan 4 costs £109.68.
- Loan 5 costs £107.04.

To calculate loans 3, 4 and 5. You add the extra amount given then divide by 12 for the equal monthly instalments.

Assume you pay the loan back in a year.

Loan Payment (P) = Amount (A) / Discount Factor (D)

> A = Total loan amount

> n = Number of periodic payments

> r = (rate / 100) \* n

> D = (((1 + r)^n) - 1) / [r(1 + r)^n]

Loan 3:

> A = `£100 + £10 = £110`

> n = `12 * 1 = 12`

> r = `0.05 / 12 = 0.004166667`

> D = `(((1 + 0.004166667)^12) - 1) / (0.004166667(1 + 0.004166667)^12) = 11.681221979`

> P = `110/11.681221979 = £9.42 (9.416823017)`

> Total loan repayment: `£9.42 * 12 = £113.04`

Loan 4:

> A = `£100 + £5 = £105`

> n = `12 * 1 = 12`

> r = `0.08 / 12 = 0.006666667`

> D = `(((1 + 0.006666667)^12) - 1) / (0.006666667(1 + 0.006666667)^12) = 11.495781777`

> P = `105/11.495781777 = £9.14 (9.133785073)`

> Total loan repayment: `£9.14 * 12 = £109.68`

Loan 5:

> A = `£100 + £3 = £103`

> n = `12 * 1 = 12`

> r = `0.07 / 12 = 0.005833333`

> D = `(((1 + 0.005833333)^12) - 1) / (0.005833333(1 + 0.005833333)^12) = 11.557120165`

> P = `103/11.557120165 = £8.92 (8.912254829)`

> Total loan repayment = `£9.92 * 12 = £107.04`

## 4.3 Not Evaluating Evidence Properly When Buying

Two shops sell the same appliance that you want. Shop A, sells it for £600 with a 5-year guarantee for a replacement if the appliance fails. Shop B offers it for £500 with no guarantee.

Tests done by a consumer group show that the appliance has a 25% chance of failing and in need of replacement each year.

Which one makes more financial sense given the evidence?

Well, let’s break this down mathematically. Each year the appliance has a 25% chance to fail. This means it has a 75% chance to not fail.

We first need to calculate the probability that it will fail across the 5 years:

`0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.237304688`

With each year that passes, the likeliness that the appliance goes up, leaving us with the following figure:

`1 - 0.24 = 0.76`

This means that the appliance has a 76% chance to fail.

The smart choice, in this example, would be to be pay from Shop A as the higher upfront cost pays off, in the long run, should the appliance fail. Outside this example, it’s better to find a more reliable appliance.

To explain the above scenario, unpredictability is not something we like. To make smart financial choices, we have to put ourselves in situations we don’t want to think about.

## 4.4 Putting off the Decision Can Be a (Bad) Decision

Putting off decisions rather than making one and finding out you chose wrongly is a common weakness.

You inherit £20,000. You get it in a split of £5,000 cash and £15,000 shares.

What would you do:

- Buy more shares?
- Make no changes?
- Sell some shares to increase the cash amount?

We have difficulty making changes so one may choose the middle option, even if it’s not the best option. This question should manifest your appetite towards risk.

# 5. Personality and Its Effect on Spending

Phineas Gage was a railway worker. He would drill holes in rock and then compress blasting powder with a tamping-iron (metal rod). Sometimes what would happen; whilst compressing blasting powder, sparks would trigger the blasting powder, shooting the rod out at high speed and that’s what happened to Phineas Gage. It went straight through his head. It took out the part of his brain responsible for emotional processing. Psychologists used to treat cognition, thinking and emotions as two separate processes. But what we’re learning more and more is that cognition and emotions intertwine and that, emotions are an important part of our thinking processes.

If we have a situation, we’ve got to make a decision, a sort of classical way of thinking about this might be: well there are some facts, we’ve got some options for making decisions, we can represent the future in some way, do a bit of internal modelling of what’s going to happen. Going on in parallel with that though is a different process. It’s the activation and biases or pre-existing scripts for deciding; based on our emotional experience of comparable situations.

But what about consumers? Looking at people’s impulsive buying behaviour and in a lot of the marketing literature, this impulsive buying is often talked about as a good thing. There’s good evidence that people who impulsive buy are often doing this as of regulating their emotions. They’re not good at managing bad emotions, going shopping turns out to be a form of emotion repair. Impulsive buyers typically have a higher chance to get into financial trouble and to go bankrupt by about 3 times more than the average. Retailers invest significant resources in engaging with impulsive shoppers. There’s a lot of effort goes into: how can we get the impulsive spend?

People see money as power, money as love, money as freedom, money as security. Money as love tends to be the female vice, money as power tends to be the male voice. We find a strong relationship to financial outcomes. Those who see money as security are more inclined to positive financial earn. A final observation to finish with; policymakers often seek to influence behaviour by providing information. Firms, through their advertisements, often seek to influence behaviour through engaging with emotions. Who is more pessimistic about influencing consumer behaviour?

# 6. Marketing Forces and Their Effect on Our Spending

A common belief is that the higher the price the more it equates to quality. It’s a mental shortcut to assess the quality and covers the shortfall in situations where information is lacking. Price and quality are not remotely related to one another.

**Mental Shortcuts We Use When Determining What to Buy**

- ’Own’ brands are products from a different label at a lower price.
- Larger-sized containers are cheaper than smaller sizes.
- When in doubt, big brands are a safe bet.
- Items tied to ’give-aways’ are not good value.
- Newly opened Stores offer attractive prices.
- Larger stores offer lower prices than smaller stores.
- Small shops give you better service than large stores.
- Higher prices are indicative of higher quality.
- Heavily advertised goods mean you buy into the label, not quality
- More recent items have better and newer technology
- Best to buy well-established products which have been market tested
- Heavy advertisement means companies believe their products will sell well
- Don’t buy ’fresh’ fish on Mondays.

These shortcuts are providing a lot of suggestions:

- Buy from big stores vs small stores
- Search for bargains vs it’s not worth the fuss
- Name brands offer protection vs. they’re a waste of money

In each case, particular groups, producers or retailers, would like you to believe in their marketing so that you spend your money on their products rather than their competitors.

# 7. Controlling Our Spending Decisions

Making sound financial decisions, including those when you’re buying big-ticket items requires a clear and coherent plan. Assess, Decide, Act, Review is the model used to ensure you take control of your spending decisions.

**Step 1. Assess Your Finances.**

- Identify items in your weekly, monthly, or annual budget where you’re paying too much.
- Use internet comparison sites
- Studying personal finance websites or sections in newspapers
- Talk to your family and friends.

**Step 2. Decide What You’re Going to Do to Improve Your Finances.**

- You may be paying too much for your gas and electricity
- Cancelling membership of clubs and societies you don’t use
- Moving to a new insurer
- It’s often worth approaching your existing supplier to see if it can offer you a better deal.
  - Compare any deal it offers with those offered by alternative suppliers to make sure you’re making the right decision, whether that’s to switch or stay.

**Step 3. Act on Your Decision.**

- Terminating your existing energy deal and signing up to a new supplier.
- Misplaced loyalty to an existing supplier can interfere with good decision-making.

**Step 4. Review Your Decisions.**

- Review the decisions you’ve made.
- Has switching supermarkets saved you money?
- Is the new gym offering better value for your money than the one you used before?

# 8. Insurance, Is It Necessary?

The four-step model provides the means to assess different insurance products rigorously whilst facilitating appropriate choices.

Each year, large sums of finance go towards insurance. If applying the model can improve product selection, we have the potential to save considerably.

First, let’s look at the basics of insurance.

Insurance is a method whereby to protect against the unexpected. To do this, you pay a premium to an insurer in exchange for protection against the losses that result from specific conditions specified in a contract. We call this an insurance policy.

When you take out an insurance policy you’re transferring to the insurer the risk of the financial loss, reducing the potential consequences to yourself.

Actuaries provide statistics to insurers to help quantify the risks that insurers are taking on. Insurers need data on the probabilities of the conditions for which they offer insurance so that they can estimate their risks of paying out.

Actuarial data will give an approximation of the future claims that the insurer might face across the range of conditions they insure. Insurers will then aim to set premiums so that, on average, total premium income will cover the cost of paying out for claims, building up reserves and making a profit.

Insurers spread their risk by insuring a multitude of individuals and households against varying risks. By insuring against numerous risks, the average number of times that insurers have to pay out will be more predictable as will be the total amount to pay out in a given year. In taking on every risk and aggregating them, the insurer faces a more predictable future than individual policyholders would if they had to face their risks themselves.

What are the different strategies people could apply for managing risk and uncertainty themselves?

They could approach it with a high-risk strategy, meaning that they could ignore the risk. Should an issue arises there could be a major negative financial consequence.

A different strategy is ’risk assumption’. This involves accepting and taking on the potential financial impact of an issue when it arises. Known as ’self-insurance’; putting savings aside to cover the costs of any potential financial loss.

- This can be a self-adopted strategy for risk takers or those who have the means to cover possible losses.
- Adopting this method can be a viable solution if other types of insurance are not available/ too expensive.

The reality is that certain insurance products are compulsory — certainly motor insurance if you have a vehicle and home insurance if you have a mortgage (lenders generally require this).

You may feel that the social fabric of the UK negates the need to buy insurance — the best example here being the existence of the NHS which, arguably, makes purchasing health insurance illogical (unless perhaps it’s offered for free or heavily discounted through your employer).

Either way each insurance category is different and making effective choices between the products — or, indeed, deciding whether you need to buy insurance in the first place — is a good place to use the four-step model.

# 9. Applying Our Model

**Step 1. Assess**

It’s important to assess the significance of what is insurable. i.e. Life insurance policies hold importance for a family with children and a single source of income.

An important factor to consider is what other protection is available.

- State benefits are part of this equation, as are any benefits available from an employer (if you’re employed).
- With large employers, benefits may include.
  - Sick pay above the statutory minimum.
  - ’death in service’ benefits.
  - Private medical insurance (PMI).

Find out what entitlements apply to you. Entitlements may not replace the need for private insurance, but it’s important to know what they are, as they may reduce any unnecessary overheads.

Use your attitude to risk as a factor; if you are more risk-averse, you will probably buy supplementary insurances to cover all cases

**Step 2. Decide**

Decide which supplementary insurance policies to buy. The greater the potential financial impact, the more you should consider insuring against it. The key is to consider whether you could bear the cost if the worst were to happen — even if the risk is low.

- Insuring your home; rebuilding costs would be far too costly, most owners decide that risk shifting makes sense (or must do so as a condition of their mortgage).

Where the costs would be smaller, self-insurance can be a better alternative.

- It may be cheaper to buy a new mobile phone rather than paying for insurance.

It’s theoretically possible to calculate the expected benefits from an insurance policy, although difficult to do in practice. You might be able to calculate the financial loss you’d suffer, but it’s unlikely you’d be able to calculate the probability of someone stealing your car, or for you to drop and break your mobile phone.

Your decisions about whether to take out insurance policies will have a direct impact on your household budget. It’s worth looking at ways you can bring premiums back down. One way to think about the impact of insurance premiums on your household budget is to realize that the current expense aims to protect you and your household from greater expenses in the future.

**Step 3. Act**

Acting to put the insurance plan into effect. This involves looking at the details of policies and comparing quotes to make sure you get the best deal.

As the UK’s insurance market is so developed, taking out most types of insurance is easy. Insurance policies are typically bought either:

- Directly from an insurance company
- Online, through price comparison websites
- Third-party, such as mobile phone shops that sell mobile insurance

Whatever route you take to buy your policy, do take time to inspect the terms of the contract with your chosen insurer. Insurance policies are not identical. You need to ensure that the policy is right for you.

**Step 4. Review**

Always review your insurance needs when policies come up for renewal and when personal circumstances change. Renewing with the same provider year after a year yields little in return for your loyalty. Instead, compare with other providers to see if you can get a cheaper deal. As with any financial plan, review and assess how this experience worked out for you. This gives you the chance to remove ’double insuring’ — to check that the same risk is not insured twice (for example, having cover for legal expenses on both your car and home insurance), which would be an unnecessary expenditure.

# 10. Mobile Phones and Insurance

This insurance product is not cheap as it can typically be between £5 and £20 per month. Adding to the fact that you may be paying for a contract with or without a phone.

Assess whether the cover justifies the cost and also what the cover include

The cover often includes the loss of your phone (theft or misplaced); it might also cover unauthorized calls, accidents and accessories taken during theft.

Policies tend to exclude certain situations such as:

- Carelessness that causes damage
- Theft of an unattended phone
- Water damage
- Delays in reporting the theft or loss of your phone

Mobile phone insurance is not risk-based so it does not reflect on your characteristics or record of claims.

It’s worth checking if your home contents insurance policy covers your mobile phone (if applicable). Some bank accounts also provide phone insurance.

If those solutions do not cover your phone, you can use the following statements to make a case for purchasing phone insurance:

- You have a history of lost and broken phones
- You are reliant on your phone and would need to replace it
- If it’s an expensive phone
- You can not afford to replace it yourself

# 11. Shopping Online

Shopping online gives you access to companies around the globe making it much easier to find offers that suit your needs at an affordable price. This may lead to people spending more than they can afford and making impulse purchases.

Here are some useful tips for consumers buying online, most tips on buying online are the same as for buying from a shop.

- Don’t visit one site before you buy. That great deal might be on offer somewhere else — and cheaper.
- Use retailers and services you know about — or recommendations from a trusted source. Check out reviews online
- A great website doesn’t mean its law-abiding
  - Know the trader’s full address, even if the company is outside the UK. The internet makes buying from abroad easy so you must know your rights.
- Don’t assume an internet company is in the UK because its web address has ’UK’ in it — check out the physical address and phone number.
- Take into account the shipping, postage and packing costs. Weigh them up against the parking and travelling costs you would have to pay if you went to the high street.
- Consider paying by credit card, if the item you’re buying costs more than £100, you get Section 75 protection, meaning you can claim from the credit card company if anything goes wrong. Buying for under £100? You’ll still get chargeback protection.
- If you are thinking of buying from an overseas website, check the costs incurred if there is a reason to return the goods.
- Look for websites that have a secure way of paying (known as an encryption facility) these show a padlock, before the web address or at the bottom of the screen when you’re filling in the payment details. Also, check the web address starts with ’https’ rather than ’http’.
- Check whether the company has the privacy statement that tells you what it will do with your personal information. GDPR requires companies to divulge this
- If buying from an auction site, check the seller’s reputation. Be careful, some traders will make up accounts and post good comments about themselves. Look at the history of the person giving feedback.
- If the price is too attractive, be wary.
