# 1. Income and Taxation

After all taxes and deductions from your gross income, what you receive is your net income.

When budgeting there are two sides to focus on:

- Calculating income
- Forecasting spending

# 2. Understanding Income Tax

As an employee, your deductions are automatically calculated taking into account

- PAYE
- National Insurance
- Pension
- Student Loans
- Any other deductions

## 2.1 Deductions from your gross earnings

The two biggest deductions from your gross income is income tax and National Insurance Contributions (NICs)

Income tax is mandatory on almost all types of income including pensions. When collected through an employer it’s often referred to as ’Pay As You Earn’ (PAYE) tax. It’s paid by an individual within the given tax year (6th April in one year — 5th April of the next year). For the years 2019/20, the untaxed portion of your salary is £12,500; your ’personal allowance’. It typically goes up to match the rate of price inflation measured by the [Consumer Price Index(CPI)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/previousReleases).

This personal allowance has a ceiling of £100,000. Anything above this limit and up to £125,000 sees a decreased personal allowance. Anything above £125,000 has no personal allowance.

Untaxed Exclusions:

- Gifts
- Lottery winnings
- Premium Bond winnings
- ISA earnings

## 2.2 Income tax in England, Wales and Northern Island

When you earn above the personal allowance in any tax year, the three bands below determine that amount of tax you pay:

- Above £37,500 gross income incurs a 20% tax rate, known as basic-rate tax
- Between £50,000 and £150,000, gross income incurs a 40% tax rate, known as higher-rate tax
- Above £150,000 gross income incurs a 45% tax rate, known as additional-rate tax

Income tax rises in proportion to your earnings (progressive tax).

## 2.3 The economic impact of income tax

Income tax accounts for nearly one-third of the government’s tax receipts. It’s used to pay for government spendings such as the police, the NHS and the civil service.

# 3. Nation Insurance Contributions

The second important deduction from your gross income is National Insurance Contributions, these come from both you as an employee and your employer.

Historically, National Insurance formed the basis for paying social security benefits related to unemployment, illness and retirement. First introduced in 1911, in the 1940s, the launch of the National Health Service and the expansion to state benefit schemes became encompassed in NICs.

Contributions from employers and employees make up close to a quarter of the government’s tax receipts.

Each person has a National Insurance Number issued by HMRC and every contribution gets recorded under this number.

The level of contributions and the number of years you’ve been paying NI influences entitlement to, and in some cases the level of, certain benefits. The state pension is a good case in point as it now requires you to have 35 years of NICs to get the full amount of state pension.

As with income tax, the rules and regulations surrounding National Insurance change annually. In 2019/20 there was a lower income threshold of £8,632 per year and an upper earnings limit of £50,000. On income between these limits, employees’ National Insurance was generally levied at 12%. If you earned more than £50,000, you paid NICs at 2% above that.

Whilst the rates and bands have not changed for 2020/21, the lower-income threshold has increased.

**Bands for Class 1 NICs in 2019/20 and 2020/21**

| Rate | 2019/20          | 2020/21          |
| ---- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| 0%   | £0 — £8,632      | £0 — £9,500      |
| 12%  | £8,632 — £50,000 | £9,500 — £50,000 |
| 2%   | £50,000+         | £50,000+         |

**Calculating tax**

For an income of £56,000 in the tax year of 2019/20, we can break down the total deductions made on the gross income:

> Income from employment or pension: `£56,000`

> Minus Personal Allowance: `£12,500`

> Total taxable: `£56,000 - £12,500 = £43,500`

> Basic Rate Tax (20%): `£37,500 * 0.2 = £7,500`

> Higher Rate Tax (40%): `£6,000 * 0·4 = £2,400`

> Tax to pay in 2019/20: `£7,500 + £2,400 = £9,900`

> Threshold for paying NICs: `£8,632`

> NICs (12%): `((£50,000 - £8,632) / 100) * 12 = £4,964.16`

> NICs (2%): `(£6000 / 100) * 2 = £120`

> NICs to pay in 2019/20: `£4,964.16 + £120 = £5084.16`

> Net Income: `£56,000 - £5084.16 - £9,900 = £41015.84`

# 4. Understanding Tax Codes

Your tax code tells your employer or pension provider how much income tax to deduct from your salary or pension and you will find it every payslip.

The code consists of four numbers and one or two letters:

- 1250L.

  - The numbers define your tax-free personal allowance — 1250 translates to £12,500
  - The letter in the code defines the nature of your income — L denotes that you have the standard tax-free allowance

There are two tax forms that you will become familiar with in your working life:

- P60:

  - Annual statement of how much you’ve earned that tax year and how much you have paid in income tax and other deductions.
  - Received from an employer within two months of each tax year (5 April).

- P45: the statement of income paid and tax deducted so far for the year when you leave a job (called the ’prevailing tax year’).
  - Your new employer will need this to determine your tax code and how much tax you’ve already paid.

**The Different Tax Codes**

|  Code  | Explanation                                                                                                                                                             |
| :----: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   L    | Entitled to the standard tax-free personal allowance                                                                                                                    |
|  M, N  | Extra marriage allowances some people are eligible for                                                                                                                  |
|   K    | Income that is not taxed another way and is worth more than the tax-free allowances                                                                                     |
|   T    | This code applies when the computation of tax due is more complicated                                                                                                   |
|   0T   | <ul><li>You have used up your personal allowance</li><li>New job and no P45 from previous employer</li><li>Employer has insufficient details to give tax code</li></ul> |
|   BR   | All taxable deductions made on your income are at the basic-rate                                                                                                        |
|   D0   | All taxable deductions made on your income are at the higher-rate                                                                                                       |
|   D1   | All taxable deductions made on your income are at the additional-rate                                                                                                   |
|   NT   | This code applies if you are paying no tax on your income. It applies to those in some categories of self-employment                                                    |
| W1, M1 | Emergency tax codes (M1 monthly, W1 weekly). Tax calculations are on the income earned in that pay period, rather than yearly                                           |

Emergency tax codes get updated automatically after you have given your employer your P45 (see above). If you’re on an emergency tax code for more than a month or two after starting a new job, it’s best to contact HMRC and ask them to send your employer an updated tax code. You will always start a new tax year with the normal tax code, not an emergency one.

# 5. Why Budget?

A budget helps in the following ways:

- Control spending by comparing income with spending
- Check you have enough income to pay for current and future bills without borrowing
- Shows spare income for saving or spending on treats/rewards
- Focus on better ways to spend money
- Plan spending goals and other targets like saving

# 6. The Income Side of the Budget

When measuring the income side of budgeting, you should consider four issues:

- Record income in the relevant period i.e. per month or annually.
- Include all sources of income
  - Paid employment
  - Self-employment
  - Savings
  - Investments
  - Pensions
  - Social Security benefits
  - ’Other’ forms of income such as selling old possessions
- Where are the sources of income coming from?
- Budgeting solely or jointly?

To identify what counts as income and wealth, think of what you are assessing:

- Income is anything in the form of cash that is spendable
- Wealth is anything that produces cash after you have sold it

# 7. The Spending Side of the Budget

Let’s try to categorize some items that we may want or need, with the categories being:

- Essential
- Desirable (not essential but hard to go without)
- Non-essential

| Item               | Categorisation                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Mobile Phone       | Essential                            |
| iPad/tablet        | Non-essential                        |
| Gym membership     | Non-essential/Desirable              |
| Eating out         | Non-essential                        |
| Streaming services | Non-Essential                        |
| Holiday            | Desirable/ Essential                 |
| Christmas presents | Desirable?                           |
| Phone insurance    | Essential? Desirable? Non-essential? |
| Daily Coffee       | Non-essential/ Desirable             |

You can do the same with your own spending habits, break them down and categorize them in the same way.

# 8. Building a Budget

Start with all income, including earnings from work, benefits, pensions and investments. If unsure about any income, it’s best not to include it.

Set out essential spending first:

- Mortgage repayments and rent
- Council tax
- Utility bills
- Essential insurance costs
- Food and drink
- Broadband
- Mobile phone bills

When that’s done, add up the essential spending items.

Now, focus on the desirable areas of spending. These are still items you’d expect to spend money on each year, it’s up to you how much you spend on these. Examples include:

- Clothing
- Holidays
- Memberships
- Meals out
- Birthday and Christmas presents

It’s also best to add a section for money set aside for a rainy day fund. This will help pay for any problems during the year. Add both the desirable spending and the essential spending.

Compare your total income with your total spending.

If spending exceeds income:

- See where you can cut back to avoid having to borrow money, or you’ll need to draw on savings to cover the gap in income.
- Easiest to focus on cutting back the non-essentials.
- Always check that you are getting the best deal you can on the essentials.

If income exceeds spending:

- Use it to add money to your savings

While building a personal budget, consider the following key rules before starting.

- Ensure you have a decent period the capture all income and spending.

  - Avoid smaller time fractions as weekly and monthly budgets may miss spending on holidays, gifts or annual insurances

- Start your budget with your net income before considering expenses
  - Include income that is certain or highly probable
- Break down your spending as far as possible. This will show where the cash is going
- Overestimate if you’re unsure about what something may cost
  - Underestimating will leave you with no budget to spare
- Divide your spending between ’essential’, ’desirable’ and non-essential’
- Add in an amount for unexpected spending (Rainy Day fund)
- It makes sense to have an annual budget, but also to break it down month by month.

The annual budget will present a high-level overview of finances and whether over the course of the year you are spending beyond your means.

The monthly budget will help you manage your day-to-day money, indicating if this is a month of heavy spending (e.g. December, with its Christmas spending for most people) or a month of light spending. Monthly snapshots will also highlight when it might be necessary to draw on savings to cover a month of heavy spending or place money in savings when the monthly spending is low.

# 9. Trimming on Spending

Ways to cut back on spending:

- Paying some bills by direct debit may save you money
- Think about remortgaging if you’re on your lender’s SVR, or your current deal is about to end
- Compare the market when renewing insurance. They often increase each year. Also, check that you’re not paying for any unwanted ’extras’
- If you’re paying high interest on your credit cards, look to see if you can transfer your balance to a new card at 0%
- Switch suppliers of gas, electricity, phone and broadband
- Consider getting a water meter, strongly consider this if you use low amounts, or there are fewer people living in your house than the number of bedrooms you have.
- If you’re paying for a gym and don’t often go, see if you can do pay as you go instead
- Think about whether a branded item is value for money or if you can live with buying a store’s own brand, or a non-branded item
- Cut down on the number of takeaway meals you have
- See if you can get a cheaper mobile tariff
- Buying in bulk for items such as contact lenses saves a lot of money
- Ditch your morning coffee from the local coffee shop
- Taking packed lunches to work can save £100s a year on lunch costs
- Buy fresh fruit and vegetables in season. Check whether a local market is cheaper than the supermarket
- Turn off lights, don’t leave appliances on stand-by and turn down the thermostat to save large amounts on energy bills
- Make a shopping list and stick to it rather than succumbing to temptation
- Be careful when buying extended warranties. They are often poor value for money so it’s better to put aside some money in case of a problem.

If you struggle to keep a track on different spending aspects, you can use the ’piggy banking’ technique.

You set up a series of accounts for each major category of your spending and use those accounts for that particular category. i.e. holidays. Split your income across these accounts according to your budget plan. By using this method of discipline you can ensure your budget stays in balance.
