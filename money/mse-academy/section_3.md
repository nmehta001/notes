# Borrowing Money

# The Boom of Borrowing in the UK

There are many forms of borrowing including:

- Credit card debt
- Overdrafts
- Loans
- Student loans
- Mortgages

Since 1993 in the UK, the aggregate total value of personal debt has risen over 3.5 times to a total of £1.7 trillion.

Roughly 85% of personal debt is secured debt (like mortgages). This is money lent against the security of property or other assets. If a borrower fails to pay the debt, these assets will become possessions of the lender.

The rest is unsecured debt (like overdrafts) where the lender has no direct recourse to a borrower’s possessions – like their house – in the event of failure to repay. This is usually more expensive than secured debt.

# Good Debt vs Bad Debt

Debt isn’t bad, but bad debt is bad. Borrowing money to have something now, that you’d otherwise need to wait for, isn’t automatically wrong.

Of course, it requires some major precautions. Borrowers should:

- Budget and plan for it
- Have the capacity to comfortably afford the repayments
- Ensure it’s at the cheapest possible rate.

Having gone through all that, provided it’s a rational, controlled, planned decision, it is a question of personal choice. Real problem debts tend to stem from three main things:

- Unexpected changes in circumstance
- Habitual overspending
- Ignorance – people borrow without understanding the true impact of it, and the fact that if you owe money you have to repay it.

Let's try to determine what is sensible borrowing and was is ill-considered borrowing

## Case Study 1

We’ve been saving up to get a mortgage, a place for my family and me to live. We’ve managed to get a big enough deposit – over 10%. We’re looking for somewhere for the long term, not an investment. We’re getting a fixed-rate mortgage for five years. It’s affordable and is cheaper than our current rent.

This is a sensible decision to borrow. The cost of borrowing is less than renting and the couple is paying an affordable mortgage to allow them to buy their own home.

## Case Study 2

I’ve just seen a 2-week holiday to Dubai. It costs £5,000. I earn £19,000 a year, but the bank says they’ll lend me the money which is repayable over three years.

This is ill-considered borrowing. Compare the income to the cost of the holiday, this is just over 1/4th of their income and takes three years to pay off. If considering a holiday next year, how would they fund that?

## Case Study 3

I lost my job six months ago and it’s been a real struggle to find a new one. This week, I’ve just been offered a new job. It’s in the countryside. I’m going to have to move myself and my family, but we’ve found a house we can afford to live in. I need a car to get to and from work. But I’ve got a very bad credit score because I’ve missed lots of payments because of lack of cash, so it’s going to cost me 20% interest on the loan and the repayments over 5 years are going to put pressure on us financially – but we can just about manage it. However, I’ve got a 3-month probation period on my job. If I don’t get the car, I can’t get the job. If I get the car and take the job but fail my 3-month probation I’m going to be in financial trouble and unable to repay the car loan.

This is arguably a sensible decision to borrow. Typically most people tend to get past their probation. If the borrower pays back on time, future lending opportunities open up and will see a decrease in the cost as the borrower's credit score improves. In the worst case, the borrower can sell the car to somewhat cover the costs of the loan. As this is quite tricky, it could be referred to as 'grey' debt

## Case Study 4

I’m buying a house. It costs £250,000. I had £25,000 in savings for a deposit, but the maximum mortgage the building society would give me was £200,000. To cover the difference I went online and borrowed the other £25,000 I needed through a 5-year bank loan.

This is ill-considered borrowing. The building society would want to know how the other £25,000 is going to be covered. When they find out it is borrowed money, they will feed the cost of this to the borrower, into their assessment of the size of the mortgage they are prepared to cover and will likely offer less in light of this.

So, whether borrowing is sensible depends on the circumstances. Certainly, borrowing is not always a ‘bad thing’. In most cases, it provides the means to buy key assets like property and cars.

# Credit Reference Agencies and Your Credit History

A key factor in borrowing money is the data gathered by credit reference agencies. Known as your credit history.

As soon as credit is taken out, it is recorded and these records build a profile against you.

Lenders then use that profile when you apply for credit, to help them predict your future behaviour based on what you’ve done in the past. To do it, they look at lots of different data – much of which is on your credit file. This may include how many applications you’ve made recently, how much you owe, what credit products you’ve had and whether you paid them all off on time.

If you don’t have a credit history, e.g. you’ve only just left school and have never taken out credit, it makes it harder to borrow money as lenders have nothing to go on.

The UK credit reference agencies that store this data are:

- Experian
- Equifax
- TransUnion

These agencies will give you a credit score with each agency having their way of scoring. Take these scores with a pinch of salt as it’s the agencies’ view of you when what matters is a lender’s view of you when you apply for credit, and every lender is different.

The information for credit history is provided by your bank or credit card provider and other organisations that have extended credit to you. This can include

- Mobile phone providers
- Utility companies
- Broadband suppliers
- Insurance companies

The information includes the:

- Amount of credit granted to you
- Whether you make repayments on time
- The proportion of your bill that you repay each month.

## How your credit history is compiled

The agencies don’t have access to or explore, all your personal information but they do examine the following:

- Have you a county court judgement (CCJ) or other court orders indicating you have a history of debt problems?
- Have you ever been convicted of fraud?
- Have you ever been the victim of identity theft or fraud?
- Have you ever defaulted on a payment (when the information shows you didn’t pay but should have done)? - Are you still in default?
- How do you operate your bank and credit card accounts? e.g, do you pay off your credit card bill in full each month?
- How many recent applications for credit have you made? Does not matter if approved or rejected.
- Are you on the electoral register? This is one vital piece of non-financial information that will affect your ability to borrow money.

By contrast, these are some of the financial and other matters that are not recorded by the reference agencies:

- Your income or pension
- Declined applications
- Criminal records
- Details about your savings and investments
- Your medical records or time taken off work for sickness
- Your race, religion, ethnicity or any political affiliations
- Student loans – although defaults on payments may be taken into account
- Your record in making Council Tax payments on time
- The timely payment of fines for driving and parking offences.

The lender will normally require the following details:

- Your age.
- Your type of employment.
  - Confirmation of whether the job is permanent or a fixed-term contract.
  - May also have to disclose completion of a probationary period.
- Your salary.
- Your marital status.
- Any financial dependants you have, e.g. children.
- Your address.
- Whether your home is owner-occupied, rented, or whether you’re living in someone else’s home.

## How to boost your creditworthiness

There are several ways to take control of and improve future credit applications.

Check credit reports once a year minimum. If the information held on the reports is incorrect, you could end up having applications for credit declined as a result of errors. Access the information on the reports of the ‘Big 3’ agencies – Experian, Equifax and TransUnion. You might be surprised to find the variations in the information held about you between these agencies. If there are errors, get them corrected.

Check your credit reports before any major applications and if you have an application for credit rejected. Having a rejection means you’ve applied, and each application puts a mark on your file. Lots of applications decrease a lender's willingness to offer credit as it looks as though you're overly reliant on it. Get errors corrected immediately as they may mean you get continuously rejected, and you want to stop that spiral.

Make sure that you’re registered on the electoral roll or that you have proof of residency. The electoral roll is updated annually. Staying registered is vital because if you’re not on the roll, it’s unlikely that any institution will want to lend to you.

Check whether you’re linked to someone financially, as their credit score can affect yours. Being ‘linked’ is simply about whether you have a joint financial product such as a joint bank account or mortgage. Being financially linked to someone on any product, that means their history is considered as part of assessing whether to accept you. Even just a joint bills account with flatmates can mean you are co-scored. Therefore, if your partner or flatmate has a poor history, keep your finances completely separate. Once finances are no longer linked (break-up, moved homes), write to the credit reference agencies and ask for a notice of disassociation. You can also find the forms online.

## Good tips to help your creditworthiness

Most of the key tips for managing and improving your credit score come down to ‘good financial habits’:

- Repay on time so they do not end up on the credit report.
- Don’t apply for lots of accounts in a short time,
  - Try to avoid any applications before something major, such as a mortgage application.
- Consider closing unused credit card accounts and cut up the cards.
  - The credit limits for these cards might limit your ability to borrow elsewhere.
  - Dispensing with cards you have used responsibly for a long period might lower your credit score so they’re often best left open
  - Don’t max out the card limits.
- Try to manage your debts, focusing on the most expensive first, as this can help your credit score.
- Avoid payday loans.

Also, remember never to lie when making any applications for credit as, if detected, this could come back to haunt you.

# Who are the lenders?

Many institutions in the UK are engaged in lending money to people and households.

There are banks and building societies, but also many others. And they’re all different.

The financial services industry is dominated by banks. They include the major ‘high street’ names, such as Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, HSBC, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander. There are also several smaller banks, like Metro Bank. Banks that do not have a branch network like First Direct, a subsidiary of HSBC, and Shawbrook Bank. These banks deal with customers via the internet, post or phone.

Building societies are different. They’re ‘mutual’ organisations, owned by their members – these are their savings and mortgages customers.

Finance companies are in many cases subsidiaries of banks, building societies or large companies. They specialise in personal loans, and motor and retail finance.

Credit Unions are cooperative organisations, often small and run on a localised basis. They can be community-based, with members tending to come from low-income groups; or work-based, with members employed by the same employer or in the same industry. One of the largest is The Open University’s credit union.

The Student Loans Company is currently owned by the UK Government. It lends to students in higher education to enable them to meet their expenses. With the cost of higher education increasing in recent years, the Student Loans Company has become a major lender.

Then there’s the high-cost credit market aimed mostly at people on low incomes. They provide high risk, unsecured lending to customers who have limited or no access to mainstream credit. As a reflection of this, the cost of credit is steep. Such lenders include payday lenders.

Finally, budgeting loans are available for people on some state benefits (or Budgeting Advances for people getting Universal Credit). These are interest-free loans which have to be paid back, and in 2019 they had a borrowing limit of £812.

The basic business model of all lenders is the same. It involves borrowing money from the public or wholesale markets and lending the money (at a profit) to people like you and me, to companies, local authorities and even governments.

# The debt supermarket: get to know the products

Here’s a run-down of the most common forms of borrowing.

### Overdrafts

An overdraft is money a bank lends you on your current account up to an agreed limit when you run out of your own money, so it takes your balance into negative territory. So, if you’re £500 overdrawn it means you have got a balance on your current account of minus £500 which at some point must be paid back. The cost of overdrafts has risen sharply from 2020 with interest rates up to 40% being charged on the amounts overdrawn.

### Credit cards

A card to spend on, up to a certain credit limit set by the lenders. It’s a debt you must pay back, and you’re billed monthly with the balance. Unless you’re on a limited-time 0% interest promotion, if you fail to pay the debt off each month, you are charged interest, which varies by provider. Even if you pay it off each month, there are some circumstances where you may be charged interest.

Store cards are a form of credit card used for buying from specified outlets. They tend to have much higher interest rates than credit cards.

### Charge cards

Can be used as credit cards to make purchases and obtain up to two months’ free credit between purchase and paying off the outstanding amount. Charge cards differ from a credit card in that a borrower is required to pay off the entire balance each month. A fee might be payable for the card.

### Loans

Loans made to individuals, typically with terms of between 1 and 10 years. They may be either unsecured or secured against an asset. Unsecured personal loans are not contractually linked to any assets the borrower buys. These are available from credit unions, banks, building societies, direct lenders and finance companies.

### Hire Purchase (HP)

A form of secured debt where repayments are made over a period, normally of up to 10 years, to purchase specific goods.

### Mortgages

Loans to purchase property or land, which are secured against these assets. Debt terms for mortgages are normally up to 25 or 30 years (though a few go-to 40 years), though as you pay interest, the longer you borrow for, the more interest you pay.

### Other (and very expensive) types of credit

These include doorstep lending and ‘payday lending’ and should only be seen as loans of last resort as the charge can be huge. Another form of alternative credit is ‘rent-to-own’ which is like hire purchase but is also very expensive as it’s a high-cost means to buy household goods. These types of loans tend to be marketed at people on lower incomes or with poorer credit histories and have been subject to several clampdowns by the authorities over poor sales tactics.

### Peer-to-peer (Peer2Peer) loans

This is an emerging form of lending where special websites link people who have money to invest with individuals or companies wanting to borrow, so you’re effectively borrowing from other individuals rather than a bank. The sites, such as Zopa and Ratesetter, profit by taking a fee.

### Personal contract purchase (PCP):

An increasingly popular form of car finance. These normally involve making a monthly payment for 2 or 3 years, at which point the residual sum left to be paid off on the car purchase is the same as its trade-in value. At this point, consumers can either make a one-off payment to complete the purchase, trade the car in for a new one (and a new PCP deal) or simply give the car back (subject to the ‘wear-and-tear’ provisions in the contract).

### Student loans

These are used to finance further and higher education studies. These are, though, not like ordinary loans or other forms of credit. The debts are only repayable when (and if) the income threshold for repayments is exceeded when former students are in employment. Student loan repayments are, in effect, another form of income tax.

# How much does it cost to borrow money?

When someone borrows money, the amount they have to repay to the lender consists of three elements.

1. The amount originally borrowed.

   - Often referred to as the principal sum or sometimes the capital sum.
   - Paid back in stages (usually monthly) over the life of the loan,
     - Possible to pay it all back at the end and just pay the interest monthly

2. The interest that has to be paid on the debt.

   - This is the key price you pay to be able to borrow, and how banks etc. make their money. It is normally expressed as a percentage per year – for example 7% per annum.

   - Simply put, on a constant £10,000 debt the cost at 7% is £700 per year. The reality is that it will be less over the year as you are likely to be paying back some of the loan.

3. Charges.
   - Charges associated with taking out, having or repaying debt, which is very common on mortgages.

## Annual Percentage Rate (APR): the key comparator for borrowing decisions

Borrowers must repay to the lender both the principal sum and the interest. There are often extra costs. Some come from ‘arrangement’ fees and intermediary (broker) fees when you get a loan in the first place and others, in certain circumstances, arise if you repay the loan before the end of the term.

Given these different potential charges and the possible differences in the timing of repayments of borrowed money, it’s important to have a good means of comparing the total cost of debt on different debt products. There is a way to create like-for-like comparisons and assess which debt product is most appropriate. Known as the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) of interest. This takes into account not only the interest rate charged on money borrowed but also when, and how often, interest is paid during each year. The APR also takes into account any other compulsory charges that are contractually part of a loan agreement.

While useful with loans and credit cards, APR as a comparator is not infallible. On mortgages, for instance, it assumes you stick with that mortgage provider for the full term and pay the standard variable rate when an introductory rate ends. The reality is many people never pay that standard rate – as they tend to switch mortgage before it’s charged - so there is little to be gained from comparing a mortgage cost over 20 years or more.

Note that APR does not include:

- Optional charges, such as buildings insurance
- ‘contingent’ charges, such as early repayment charges

Generally, a low APR means lower costs for the borrower.

## Setting interest rates and the role of the Bank of England

The rate set by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), also known as ‘Bank Rate’, is the rate at which the Bank of England will lend to the financial institutions. This determines the level of bank ‘base rates’ – the minimum level at which the banks will normally lend money. The result is that the Bank Rate (also known as the ‘official rate’) effectively sets the general level of interest rates for the economy as a whole.

The Bank of England’s MPC meets eight times a year to consider policy and set its Bank Rate in the light of economic conditions – in particular the prospects for price inflation (the rate of increase in the price of consumer products like groceries, clothing, household goods and fuel).

The prime objective is for the MPC to set interest rates at a level consistent with keeping price inflation at around 2% p.a. If the MPC believes inflation will go above 2% p.a. it might increase interest rates to discourage people from taking on debt – because if people spend less, it could reduce the upward pressure on prices. Conversely, if the MPC believes inflation will be much below 2% p.a. it might lower interest rates (also known as ‘easing monetary policy’), and people might then borrow and spend more.

After 2013 this approach to setting Bank Rate was modified to take into greater account other measures of economic activity, like the level of unemployment.

One other factor to consider is the difference between price inflation and interest rates – the difference is referred to as the ‘real’ interest rate. When interest rates are higher than price inflation, then real interest rates are positive. This is good news for savers who will see the purchasing power of their savings rising. When price inflation exceeds interest rates, then real interest rates are negative. This is bad news for savers who will see the purchasing power of their savings falling.

For anyone who is borrowing, the reverse applies – positive real interest rates are bad news, but negative real interest rates are good news.

# Low cost and high-cost borrowing

To emphasize the previous sections, some statements generally match the methods of borrowing (These are relative to the average cost of the six ways of borrowing):

- A. Low-cost interest rate
- B. High-cost interest rate if not on a promotional rate – e.g. 0% rate for an introductory period
- C. You risk having an asset (e.g. your home) repossessed if you don’t keep up repayments
- D. Can be interest-free for a time (e.g. introductory 0% rates for balance transfers)
- E. They can often get you price discount the first time you use them to buy goods in a shop
- F. If this facility has been pre-arranged, you can use it to borrow immediately without having to notify your bank
- G. The lender will need a valuation of the asset you are buying before lending money
- H. You have discretion about what you spend the borrowed money on
- I. Borrowing in this way might impair your credit score

| Method of Borrowing | Features of Consequences (A - I) |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Mortgage            | A, C, G                          |
| Bank Loan           | A, F, H                          |
| Overdraft           | B, F, H                          |
| Credit Card         | B, D, H                          |
| Store Card          | B, E, H                          |
| Payday Loan         | B, H, I                          |
