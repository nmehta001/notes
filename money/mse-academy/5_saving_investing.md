# 1. Why Save for the Future?

When thinking about the reasons for people set money aside, what we’re truly thinking about is why defer consumption of that money as opposed to consuming it there and then.

There exists specific and non-specific reasoning behind this thought process.

**Future Purchases — Both Known and Unknown**

Knowing what you want in the future allows you to set aside a certain amount of money periodically, with future goals including:

- Buying a home
- A car
- Christmas budgeting

The point being, you set aside money for goods or services you don’t yet know you need or want.

**A Safety Net**

This involves building up a buffer of funds to provide for unexpected events and bills, which can provide you with emotional and practical security because you know you have funds to call upon if you needed them.

**Supporting a Change in Lifestyle**

Having enough savings could enable you to leave a job, to take a break for a given number of months. It could also enable you to do or buy what you want, or to take advantage of opportunities that arise (such as being able to pay for education or start a business).

**Planning for Later Life**

One of the most significant purposes for saving is to help provide money for retirement. Another reason could be to have money set aside to pass to your dependants when you die.

The reasons above all underline an important aim of having savings — to ensure you do not overdo it now and leave yourself short for important future expenditure, and to create financial security and independence.

## 1.1 The Difference Between Saving and Investing

People often use the terms ’saving’ and ’investing’ as well as ’savings’ and ’investments’ interchangeably. People place their money in a range of different products in the hopes of ’saving up’, the common goal being to build up a sum of money over time.

Yet there is a clear distinction between these terms.

**Saving Up**

Putting of money aside to use at a future date for an array of possible purposes.

- Savings products or savings accounts.

  - These are simple products where you save money with a bank, building society or credit union, and you gain interest.
  - Crucially, other than for large savers, the value of the capital (the amount you originally save) is not at risk if it’s protected with a UK-regulated financial institution.
  - Money is not at risk, you will always receive the amount you put in at worst.
  - Protected up to £85,000 per person, per bank, building society or credit union, up to £170,000 for joint accounts.

**Investment Products**

- Here, there is risk but also possible greater rewards than with a savings account.
  - The value of your cash can subsequently go up and down depending on the performance of your investment.
- Not necessarily a bad thing but be aware that your money is at risk and you may not receive what you originally put in.
- Better to not put use this product if you will withdraw it in the short term.

# 2. The UK’s Savings Problem

Whatever your reasons for saving money, the reality is that the UK is not good at doing it! The data in the tables below make this clear. The UK’s savings ratio is lower than most other European countries (Table 1) and over the past twenty years, it’s been getting worse (Table 2).

**European Savings Ratios 2018. Savings as a % of disposable income. (Table 1)**

| Country                  | Savings Ratio (%) |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Sweden                   | 15.40             |
| Germany                  | 10.95             |
| Netherlands              | 8.40              |
| France                   | 8.38              |
| Ireland                  | 5.78              |
| European Union (average) | 3.70              |
| United Kingdom           | 0.37              |

**UK Savings Ratio 2000-2018. Savings as a % of disposable income. (Table 2)**

| Year | Savings Ratio (%) |
| ---- | ----------------- |
| 2000 | 4.97              |
| 2004 | 3.68              |
| 2008 | 3.79              |
| 2012 | 4.35              |
| 2016 | 1.74              |
| 2018 | 0.37              |

Source: OECD (2020)

The Savings Ratio in the UK is low and theories exist that compliment this statement.

The past decade has seen the value of real income, income after adjusting for price inflation, fall for the majority of people. With less money spare after meeting household bills, savings perhaps inevitably suffer.

Another reason may be the availability of debt. Borrowing money rather than drawing on savings is what most do to cover for life’s emergency spending or, say, the cost of a holiday. Yet this can be an expensive way of covering such costs.

One reason for the decline in the UK’s savings ratio is that interest rates in the UK have been at historically low levels since the financial crisis in the late 2000s — and reached a record low in March 2020 after the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic hit the UK. With the interest paid on savings accounts being so low, the incentive to save is less, with people opting to spend the money instead.

# 3. What Savings Accounts Can I Get?

When selecting your savings accounts, one key decision is whether to go for an easy access product with variable rates or a fixed-rate product.

Fixed-rate products, commonly referred to as ’bonds’, are savings accounts that pay a fixed interest rate.

Another decision to make is whether to go for a cash ISA or a standard savings account. The basic premise of a cash ISA is simple, they’re normal savings accounts where there is no tax on the interest.

## 3.1 Savings Accounts

#### 3.1.1 Easy Access (Or ’Instant Access’) Accounts

These tend to give you easy access so you can make withdrawals at will (though some limit the total number you can make per year). They tend to pay lower rates than fixed-rate accounts but are a good place to keep your money if you’re going to need it soon (or frequently).

The interest rates are variable, meaning they move up and down, in line with the Bank of England’s Bank. The exact timing and scale of the moves lie with the bank or building society and can happen at any time.

Make sure you also keep an eye out for introductory ’bonus’ rates. These are temporary interest boosts to attract new customers. They’re a good thing, as they effectively act as a rate guarantee during the introductory period, promising you at least some interest. But it’s vital to remember the end date for the bonus and switch as soon as it ends, so you don’t languish on a rubbish rate.

#### 3.1.2 Fixed-Rate Accounts

These often give a better return than their easy access counterparts and you get certainty about the interest you’ll receive. A fixed-rate account is a savings account where the amount you earn doesn’t change over a fixed period, anything from 1 to 5 years.

Fixed rates are a little higher than rates on easy access accounts. If current savings rates were to increase during that time, they would be of no benefit to this product. On the flip side, they protect in case rates drop in that time given their fixed nature.

In most cases, access to the cash stays locked to the account, unless it’s held within a cash ISA. Some banks allow premature withdrawals for a fee but this is rare. After the COVID-19 pandemic hit the UK, banks relaxed withdrawal rules for people in financial difficulty. Yet if you get a fixed-rate account unless the terms allow for premature withdrawals, do not count on it.

#### 3.1.3 Notice Accounts

This is a hybrid of the two. Here, you have to give notice when you want to take money out, of say, 60 or 90 days. Rates tend to be variable and you tend to get better rates than on easy access, but they do not tend to be as high as fixed-rate accounts.

#### 3.1.4 Limited Access Accounts

These are accounts where you can withdraw money but on specific terms — for example, one withdrawal per year or, say, up to two or three withdrawals. More withdrawals will result in charging the saver, this can be a reduction in the interest paid to them.

#### 3.1.5 Regular Savings Accounts

Most regular savings accounts require you to put money away each month with interest paid yearly. They offer higher interest rates than traditional fixed or easy access savings accounts but tend to impose rigid terms and conditions.

- Limiting the withdrawals you can make
- Forcing you to make a deposit every month

After a year, your cash tends to sweep into a bog-standard account — so be sure to ’ditch ’n’ switch’ to a better deal.

You may wonder why you would want to save in an account that restricts withdrawals. The simple answer is that accounts with controlled access tend to offer (slightly) higher interest rates than instant or easy access accounts. That’s the incentive.

## 3.2 What About Premium Bonds?

The nation’s most popular way of saving is through buying Premium Bonds, operated by National Savings and Investments (NS&I), backed by the government. This method means your money fully protected.

Despite the term ’bond’, they are a form of savings. But instead of earning interest, your bonds enter a prize draw each month, where you can win up to £1 million. Each bond costs £1 with the least put in being £25 and at most £50,000.

The prize money paid each year equated on average (in May 2020) to 1.3% of the total amount held by all savers in premium bonds. Whilst you may win £1 million or nothing, this average is useful to compare with the interest rates paid on savings accounts.

Most people will earn less than the average as the million-pound prizes consist of all the money pooled together. You more often than not going to get a higher return in a normal savings account than in Premium Bonds, based on average luck, given you can earn more than 1.3% elsewhere.

If you win anything, Premium Bond prizes are tax-free. That may appear a big boon but 95% of people don’t pay tax on their savings anyway.

# 4. Should You Get an ISA?

Cash ISAs are like standard savings accounts but there is no tax to pay on the interest.

Each tax year, the government sets an annual limit on the amount of new savings that you can place into ISA products. In 2020/21 this was £20,000.

Note that the choice between standard savings and a cash ISA is not the no-brainer it once was. Before 2016, the cash ISA was the clear winner due to its tax-free status.

But since then, the personal savings allowance has come in (explained later in this session) which means the majority of people do not pay tax on their normal savings anyway, the choice comes down to getting the best rate when looking at both normal savings and cash ISAs. Do note that ISAs will hold their tax-free status indefinitely (unless the rules change) so may still win in the long run, as you may pay tax if your normal savings build up.

## 4.1 Home or Retirement

Two other ISA products that are worth mentioning, one of which is still open and the other is running but closed to all new applicants.

#### 4.1.1 Lifetime ISAs

LISAs are available to anyone aged between 18 and 39, as a means to save for a first home or your retirement, and you can save up to £4,000 per tax year. You earn tax-free interest, the state will provide a bonus of 25% of the amount you save each year until the age of 50. It’s possible to accumulate bonuses of up to £33,000 by saving the £4,000 per year and getting a £1,000 (25%) bonus for 33 years.

LISAs have strict rules about what you can do with these savings:

- Help with buying your first property in the UK.

  - Must be a primary home
  - Must cost up to £450,000.

- Help build up a fund to provide pension income from the age of 60.

If you withdraw money from your LISA before you’re 60 for anything other than buying your first property, you will incur a 25% penalty on what you withdraw. The exemption from this charge is if you are terminally ill. If you open a LISA, be sure that you won’t need the money for any purposes other than to buy your first home or to provide retirement income. But even if you use it for an income in later life, there are risks and you may be better off saving via other means (e.g. maxing employer contributions via a workplace pension), so do some more homework first.

#### 4.1.2 Help-To-Buy ISAs

These are no longer available for new applicants, but if you have one already, they can go towards buying your first property. The state tops up these cash ISA accounts by 25%, up to £3,000.

- No penalties for withdrawing the money
- If you do not use it to buy a property you will not get the state bonus

The government incentivizes savings and tax breaks via bonuses because of the poor saving record the UK has.

Households with access to savings can manage mini-crises — for example, the need to pay for household repairs or replacement appliances — without resorting to borrowing money, perhaps via expensive methods such as using a credit card.

The difficulties that young people have in getting on to the property ladder is arguably the catalyst for the support now provided by LISAs and, formerly, Help-to-buy ISAs.

LISAs can also help those who need to build up their pension funds to sustain them in retirement. Given the shortfall in the funds’ people need for their retirement, this support from the government is helpful.

# 5. Interest and Tax

The financial services’ industry must show interest rates on all savings products in a way that allows easy comparison. Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is the interest rate for debt products. Annual Equivalent Rate (AER) is the term used for savings products. The AER is the annual interest rate that savers receive, taking into account when and how often interest is paid (for instance, annually or monthly).

- The interest in both variable and fixed-rate accounts pays out either annually or monthly — sometimes you get a choice.

- Products can offer varying arrangements for where interest goes. Commonly interest earned accumulates on your account balance, you may be able to request that your bank account receives the interest instead.

#### 5.1 The Personal Savings Allowance

Under the Personal Savings Allowance, basic-rate (20%) income taxpayers can, in 2020/21, earn £1,000 in interest tax-free in a standard savings account. For higher-rate taxpayers (40%) the allowance is £500, while top-rate payers (45%) don’t get a tax-free allowance.

With interest rates on savings accounts around 1% — 1.5% in recent years, ISA accounts are no longer the primary method of holding untaxed savings. By 2019 the Government estimated that 95% of savers did not pay any tax on their savings. This helps to explain why cash ISAs have lost much of their shine, as the gain compared to a normal savings account has been greatly diminished.

On savings products, you’re given the choice about when you receive interest. This is most commonly a choice between receiving interest annually or monthly.

But if you opt for monthly, the stated interest rate paid (called the gross rate) is always slightly less than the AER — for example, a 1.29% rate if paid monthly or 1.3% annually. Why is this?

The gross rate and AER should be the same when interest comes in annually as there’s no interest compounding.

Yet when interest comes in monthly, the gross rate given is a bit less than the AER rate. This is because the monthly interest would become compounding as you are earning interest on the interest. The AER makes sure to include this.

When paying interest out monthly, the gross AER rate would be 1.29%. When paying interest out annually, the gross AER would be 1.3%. Leaving the money there for the year would result in both receiving the same amount, as the AER is 1.3%

# 6. Final Points

Some of the most attractive interest rates on paper are via specialist current accounts where the interest paid can be much higher than on standard savings accounts with some important caveats.

- To get these attractive interest rates you have to commit to a minimum deposit (say, £1,000) into the current account each month.

  - This is a ploy to get you to pay in your monthly salary or pension.
  - Helps to ensure a regular, reliable and fair-sized cash inflow into the account.

- You will earn interest on a certain amount regardless of your balance, say £2,500.

  - Prevents people from transferring large sums of money into the account.
    - This can be a way to earn interest on your monthly incomings.

- You may need to pay out a certain number of direct debits per month.
  - This is a ploy to make you use this as your main current account and not a savings account.

You may want to use your current account as a way to save some of your money. You should always take into consideration the interest you earn to select an account.

#### 6.1 How Do I Want to Operate My Accounts?

You need to check out the way you can operate your savings account.

- Is it an online-only account?
- Can you operate the account in some other way?

# 7. Money Safety and Savings Accounts

The minor risk would be that the financial institution goes into liquidation. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) protects you up to £85,000, per person, per financial institution, anything beyond is not covered.

If you are close to any limits, it makes sense to secure your money in any ways possible. The limit varies periodically as it’s based on the UK sterling conversion of €100,000, which fluctuates between the exchange rate of the Pound and the Euro. The limit could change when the UK leaves the European Union.

#### 7.1 Extra Protection

If you exceed the £85,000 limit that the FSCS protects, they can offer protection for up to £1 million for 6 months. To do this you need to provide proof for where the high balance has come from:

- Selling a property
- Payout under an insurance policy
- Personal injury compensation
- Pay-off after redundancy
- Benefits payable on retirement
- Inheritance

#### 7.2 Other Savings Risks

Inflation risk applies to savings accounts. The amount before inflation and the value of the savings is a difference that needs proper thought. If your savings earn 1% AER and price inflation is 2% per annum (p.a.) then the real value of your savings will be falling.

If this persists for years you may find that, despite the interest earnings, what you can buy with your savings will be a bit less than you could have bought before you started saving!

While savings accounts are low risk, the ’real’ returns they offer, after price inflation, are low and, at times, negative.

Savings accounts are subject to interest rate risks.

- Variable rates will see a loss in earnings should the interest rates fall
- Fixed-rates will see no benefits should interest rates rise

The final risk to consider is ’access risk’, the inability to withdraw funds without incurring a charge on a fixed-rate account. By managing your finances you never need to access your fixed-rate accounts before the end of their term (of, say, 1 year).

# 8. Drawing up Your Savings Strategy

The key is to match the savings accounts you choose to your reasons for saving and, of course, to pick the highest rate possible. It’s best to work on more general principles rather than fixed rules on what you should or shouldn’t do.

- You don’t have to have a single savings accounts.

  - You are free to open and close them as you see fit

  - An example would be a fixed-rate account for long term savings and an easy-access account to draw on when you need it

  - If you have more than £85,000 in savings, then you spread it between different financial institutions.

Access to your money and choosing between fixed vs variable rates are also important, though these decisions go hand-in-hand given the product structure.

- Consider whether you may need access soon

  - If this is the case then an easy-access is a natural choice, be aware of the rates drop if it’s a variable rate.

- If you don’t need access then a regular savers has the best rates.

  - The caveat here is that you can input a certain limit.

- If you want a secure rate and won‘t touch the money for a while then fixed-rate is the best bet.

  - The downsides again are being no benefits taken from bank rate increases.

If you are saving for a first home and are between the ages 18 and 39 then LISAs are a no-brainer for most people.

- Open one if you are sure you will use it for that purpose and your home will cost less than £450,000, otherwise, you won’t reap the rewards.

# 9. Investments

With investments (which can include shares, bonds or investment funds that can hold these types of assets), the investment itself can fall or rise in value which adds a significant risk, but can also lead to much bigger rewards. Take into account any fees that you may need to pay.

Another class of investments are investment funds, which pool lots of investors’ money into a giant fund where a manager may invest that cash in different investment types such as shares, commodities and property.

Pensions work on this principle so even if this way of investing is not for you, you are already are an investor.

## 9.1 Shares

Shares are also called ’equities’. They entitle the holder to a share or part ownership in a company. Depending on the share, this may entitle the shareholder to vote on how the company runs. Shares can entitle their owners to receive dividends that the company pays out of the profit it makes. The payout from these dividends is the shareholders’ reward for investing in the company.

(Source: The Times, 5 October 2019, p. 69 and The Sunday Times, 6 October 2019, p. 14)

Here’s an explanation of the information presented in the columns of the table.

- High: The highest price of a share over a certain period.
- Low: The lowest price of a share over a certain period.
- Company: The name of the company.
- Price: The current price of a share, shown in pence (this is the price at the end of the previous working day).
- +/-: The change in the quoted share price from the previous day.
- Yield: The earnings generated and realized on an investment over a particular period.
- P/E: The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is the ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its per-share earnings.

The most telling information is where the current share price is concerning the high and low points in the past year. The investor can see that share prices close to the year’s high are doing better than those that are closer to the year’s low. If most/ all share prices are nearer to the year’s low then the equity market is experiencing a period of weakness. The Yield and P/E columns are little more complex to interpret, for example, a high yield might be due to a company paying a higher dividend to keep investors happy at a time of difficulties for the business.

The price of a share varies from minute to minute depending on the balance of investors who want to buy and sell them. 
  - When an investor sells at a higher price relative to the price they bought it for, they make a capital gain, otherwise, it’s a loss if they sell it for less.

Stockbrokers sell shares, and they can be a specialist company or an arm of a high street bank. You can find one via a variety of methods, be that word-of-mouth, through the internet, or the Personal Investment Management and Financial Advice Association (PIMFA).

## 9.2 Bonds

The other main kind of financial investment product is a bond, with the issuing bodies being companies or the government. Bonds are also referred to as ’fixed interest’ investments.

A bond is a loan made by an investor to a borrower. You buy a bond from a stockbroker with cash and the borrower promises to repay the money invested on a set date. The borrower also pays you interest on defined dates during the life of the bond. The interest rate is typically fixed, for instance, at 2% or 5% per annum.

Bonds tend to be less risky than shares because they have a promised interest rate, and because company bondholders rank in front of company shareholders in the event of a liquidation.

Although less risky than shares, bonds are riskier than savings accounts. This is because, with savings products, you receive a fixed amount back — if you deposit £100, you get £100 back (plus interest).

With a bond, if it’s sold before maturity, you may receive more or less than the original amount you put in. Whether it’s more or less will depend on movements in the level of interest rates after issuing the bond.

Another risk of bonds is, if the issuer of a bond goes bust then you have no protection and may lose your investment. 

## 9.3 Commodities

A further category of investments is commodities. The investments consist of an asset such as oil, gold, metals or agricultural products.

Generally, there are two major attractions to these investments:

- The prices of commodities tend to rise during periods of price inflation. They offer a ’hedge’ against the risk that inflation erodes the real value of your investments.

- Commodity prices also often move in the opposite direction to other asset classes such as shares and property. 
  - During periods of weakness in equity markets, moving to gold might be the right choice. 
  - As a consequence, investing in commodities can be an effective way to balance the risks on a portfolio also containing assets like shares and property.

Commodity prices can be volatile and are certainly at risk of periodic sharp falls. In some ways, such investments have the same risk as investing in an individual share as opposed to investing in a balanced portfolio of shares.

**How can I make investments in commodities?**

Three options exist for the ordinary investor:

- Physically purchasing and storing the commodity

  - Useful with assets such as gold
  - Consider insurance against theft or damage

- Purchasing shares in companies whose financial performance related to the commodity of interest.

  - Mining companies are good if you want to invest in metal, etc
  - The financial performance and share prices have a weak correlation against the commodities associated with them.

- Invest in funds that track the price of a specific commodity/ basket of defined commodities.
  - Placing money in exchange-traded funds (ETFs)

## 9.4 Property Investment

For years property has become a serious alternative to other kinds of investments.

For most people, the biggest investment they have is in their own home. Equity is the difference between the market value of your home and the remaining mortgage you may have on it. It could amount to a large sum for those who have paid off their mortgage or are close to doing so.

You may see your primary home as an investment, as well as a place to live in, as you hope it will rise in value. You could also invest in a second (or third, fourth, etc.) home.

- If selling anything other than your primary home, you will have to pay Capital Gains Tax (CGT) on any profit made.
- Buying anything other than a primary home you will pay stamp duty.

Property investment is profitable in a diverse amount of ways.

- Buying in and ’up and coming’ area where the price rise more than the average

  - You buy below market value by finding a suitable refurbishment project sell it for profit

There is a possibility of purchasing a property with it being a loss due to different factors

- You can rent out the property

  - Landlords tend to use the rent payment to pay off the mortgage on the property or to maintain a high standard

The risk here is the ability to find a tenant in time.

An alternative way to invest in property without directly owning specific properties is through investment funds known as Real Estate Investment Companies (REICs).

## 9.5 Investment Funds

Buying shares in a single company or even holding shares in, say, three companies, can be a risky form of investment. This is due to company profits and financial performance being subject to all sorts of risks:

- Recession
- Increase in the cost of assets
- Company-specific risks such as loss of a major contract
- etc

The same applies to buying bonds issued by companies and other institutions, although the price of these is less volatile than shares.

To spread these risks, investors can invest in shares (and other assets, such as bonds) through investment funds. An investment fund pools the money of lots of investors and uses it to hold a wide range of shares, bonds and/or other assets. You can spread even small amounts of money across a wider variety of shares and other assets.

When investing, be clear about the types of assets a fund holds and in what proportions. This is because any investment you make will hold these assets in equal proportions. The proportions held also determine the risk profile of the fund.

**Funds and risk profiles**

|                        | Fund 1   | Fund 2      | Fund 3    |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Bonds                  | 78%      | 53%         | 30%       |
| Shares                 | 12%      | 37%         | 60%       |
| Property               | 10%      | 10%         | 10%       |
| Typical Classification | Low-risk | Medium-risk | High-risk |

In this context, risk means exposure to a fall in value.

The key to determining risk with each fund is the percentage value that they attribute to each investment option. With shares being the riskiest investment option you can see how it scales across the three funds from low to high risk.

When we talk about ’actively managed’ funds, we’re referring to investments selected based on research that assesses the prospects for shares and other bonds. This selection process can fall to a manager who would do this on behalf of the investor; this manager will report back with periodic updates on the investments.

We also have ’passively managed’ or ’tracker’ funds, these investments move in-line with a specified share index. These have a lower charge rate as the work required is not as much for a manager.

Investment funds come in other forms, including:

- Unit trusts: an arrangement where trustees will hold shares and/or assets for an investor and a management company will make decisions on what and when to buy and sell. Profits then go back to the unit owner instead of reinvestment in the fund.

- Open-ended investment companies (OEICs): These are like unit trusts but structured around companies as opposed to trusts.

- Investment trusts: companies that are quoted and traded on the stock market. The purpose of an investment trust company is to run an investment fund. Investors buy shares in the company. The price of the shares reflects both the value of the assets in the underlying fund (called the ’net asset value’ or NAV) and the balance between investors buying and selling the shares on the stock market.

- Exchange-traded funds (ETFs): these are also companies traded on the stock market but, in this case, the share price is directly linked to the value of the underlying investments. Traditionally, ETFs are tracker funds. This could be, for example, a FTSE-100 Index tracker or a more unusual index tracking, say, the price of commodities or works of art.

- Life insurance funds: some types of life insurance can provide a way into investments. The investor pays in regular premiums or a single lump-sum premium, and the policy builds up a cash value that you can draw out either as a lump sum or as a stream of income payments.

- Pension funds: You can invest your contributions into different underlying funds. The value of the pension scheme depends on the performance of those funds.

Investment funds are directly available from fund managers, through stockbrokers or through specialist websites (often called ’platforms’).

One way that you can invest money in a fund is through Stocks and Shares ISAs. You must not exceed the £20,000 (2020/21) limit set by the government, this is inclusive of any cash ISA accounts as well.

# 10. Investment Strategies: Managing Risk

There are some key principles to help make decisions when investing:

- Investing is a long-term process, you will need to ride out the times when your investment falls in value.
  - Manage your expectations and don‘t expect to see massive short-term gains.

- If your investment falls in value early on, this is not a problem. What matters is the price you buy and sell at. 
  - There is time for your investment to recover.
  - Don‘t sell at the bottom of the market as you will solidify any losses made.

- Don‘t put all your investments into one area, it’s better to spread out your capital.

- Consider the tax benefits of investing in a stocks and shares ISA. 


# 11. Peer-to-peer (P2P) Products

This product is not a means of saving, the FCA has reprimanded companies who advertise it as such.

This market has grown as savers have seen returns on their savings falls to incredibly small amounts in recent years. Investors pool together their funds with other investors and lending to individuals and businesses. The P2P provider undertakes the credit check on borrowers whilst also taking a cut to make a profit.

The Peer2Peer Finance Association recorded that £3 billion was lent out in 2018 alone. This body is now under Innovative Finance as of 2020.

**The Significant Risks of P2P Lending**

It may be that the borrower defaults and is unable to fully pay off the loan. It’s possible to recover the money lent, although it would take a long time.

P2P investments are not covered by the FSCS, so if a provider goes bust, investors can lose all their money.

# 12. Taking Up Financial Advice?

The benefit of getting advice is that you should get the products that meet your needs and your risk appetite. Bear in mind that it’s not always certain you will make money and that advice given is based on logical predictions.

Some advisers are independent and can provide you with a full range of information on products that interest you when it comes to investments. Other advisers may offer a more restricted service where they offer a finite set of products. Advisers will always disclose whether they are ‘restricted’ or not in the guidance they can provide.


Advised product sales give you the flexibility to hear what options are available, then leaving the product choice up to you as opposed to being non-advised about a product.

Advised sales point you to particular products. If your adviser recommends an unsuitable product, you have a good case for claiming it has been ‘mis-sold’ to you. Be aware that unsuitable is not the same as ‘loss-making’.

If you end up with an unsuitable product on the recommendation of an adviser, then you may have a case for claiming that it has been ’mis-sold’ to you. ’Unsuitable’ is not the same as ’loss-making’: as investments are risky some people do lose money even after making what sounded like a good investment at the outset.

The key questions to ask yourself are:

- Am I an experienced investor?
- Can I afford to lose at least part of the capital sum invested?
- Have I the time to both put in the research ahead of investing and then watch the investment after I have acquired it?
  
If your answer is no to at least one of the following questions then seeking financial advice is worth considering. 
  - If the answer is no to all three questions, advice is essential.

Yes to all three questions means you may consider yourself able to make your own decisions and to transact without advice using a low-cost provider of the products you want.

**What Do I Get Charged for Advice?**

Advisers must set out explicitly the fees charged for the advice provided. These fees vary from adviser to adviser so inspect the fees and check how they compare with those of other advisers.

If you are seeking general financial advice or advice in respect of specific products, advisers will charge a fee and must notify you of the fees they charge upfront. Some advisers may provide an initial consultation free of charge.

Before 2013, advisers often earned their income by receiving commission from the product providers which was then deducted from customers’ initial or ongoing investment. This practice ceased on pensions and investments to ensure that there is complete transparency about fees charged.

**Where Do I Go to Find an Adviser If I Need One?**

You may find a good adviser through word-of-mouth or online. Practice caution, that the adviser is not steering you solely towards the products offered by any associated institution.

The [Money and Pensions Service](https://moneyadvice.org.uk/en/categories/getting-advice-about-retirement) provides guidance on the use of financial advisers, [Unbiased](https://unbiased.co.uk) provides a list of authorized financial advisers. You can also check an adviser against the [FCA register](https://register.fca.org.uk).
