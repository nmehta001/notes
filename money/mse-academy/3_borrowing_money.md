# 1. The Boom of Borrowing in the UK

Since 1993 in the UK, the total value of personal debt has risen over 3.5 times to a total of £1.7 trillion.

About 85% of personal debt is ’secured’, meaning that the money lent is against the security of a property or other assets. If a borrower fails to pay the debt, the assets become possessions of the lender.

The other 15% is ’unsecured’ debt, a lender will not be able to take action against a borrower’s possessions to recover the debt. It’s also a more expensive form of borrowing.

Forms of borrowing including:

- Credit card debt
- Overdrafts
- Loans
- Student loans
- Mortgages

# 2. Good Debt vs Bad Debt

Debt isn’t all bad. Borrowing money to have something now, that you’d otherwise need to wait for, isn’t automatically wrong.

Of course, it requires some major precautions. Borrowers should:

- Budget and plan for it
- Have the capacity to comfortably afford the repayments
- Ensure it’s at the cheapest possible rate.

Debt problems tend to stem from the following situations:

- Unexpected changes in circumstance
- Habitual overspending
- Ignorance — people borrow without understanding the true impact of it, and the fact that if you owe money you have to repay it.

Let’s try to determine what is sensible borrowing and was is ill-considered borrowing

**Case Study 1**

We’ve been saving up to get a mortgage, a place for my family and me to live. We’ve managed to get a big enough deposit — over 10%. We’re getting a fixed-rate mortgage for five years. It’s affordable and is cheaper than our current rent.

This is a sensible decision to borrow. The cost of borrowing is less than renting and the couple is paying an affordable mortgage to allow them to buy their own home.

**Case Study 2**

I’ve seen a 2-week holiday to Dubai. It costs £5,000. I earn £19,000 a year, but the bank says they’ll lend me the money which is repayable over three years.

This is ill-considered borrowing. Compare the income to the cost of the holiday, this is over 1/4th of their income and takes three years to pay off. If considering a holiday next year, how would they fund that?

**Case Study 3**

I lost my job six months ago and it’s been a real struggle to find a new one. This week, I’ve secured an offer for a new job. It’s in the countryside. I’m going to have to move myself and my family, but we’ve found a house we can afford to live in. I need a car to get to and from work. But I’ve got a bad credit score because I’ve missed lots of payments because of lack of cash, so it’s going to cost me 20% interest on the loan and the repayments over 5 years are going to put pressure on us financially — but we can manage. I’ve got a 3-month probation period on my job. If I don’t get the car, I can’t get the job. If I get the car and take the job but fail my 3-month probation I’m going to be in financial trouble and unable to repay the car loan.

This is arguably a sensible decision to borrow. Typically, most people tend to get past their probation. If the borrower pays back on time, future lending opportunities open up and will see a decrease in the cost as the borrower’s credit score improves. In the worst case, the borrower can sell the car to somewhat cover the costs of the loan. This is a tricky situation, a ’grey’ area.

**Case Study 4**

I’m buying a house. It costs £250,000. I had £25,000 in savings for a deposit, the total mortgage the building society would give me was £200,000. To cover the difference I went online and borrowed the other £25,000 I needed through a 5-year bank loan.

This is ill-considered borrowing. The remaining £25,000 will be of concern to the building society. In most cases, they would offer less than the original amount because they are now factoring in the extra money borrowed. Depending on the circumstances, borrowing can be a sensible move. Certainly, borrowing is not always a ’bad thing’. In most cases, it provides the means to buy key assets like property and cars.

# 3. Credit Reference Agencies and Your Credit History

A key factor in borrowing money is the data gathered by credit reference agencies. Known as your credit history.

A record of any credit you take out builds a profile against you.

Lenders then use that profile when you apply for credit, to help them predict your future behaviour based on what you’ve done in the past. To do it, they look at lots of different data, including:

- The frequency of recent applications
- Amounts you owe
- Credit products you’ve had and whether you paid them all off on time.

If you don’t have a credit history, e.g. you’ve left school and have never taken out credit, it makes it harder to borrow money as lenders have nothing to go on.

The UK credit reference agencies that store this data are:

- Experian
- Equifax
- TransUnion

These agencies will give you a credit score with each agency having their way of scoring. Take these scores with a pinch of salt as it’s the agencies’ view of you when. What matters is a lender’s view of you is and every lender is different.

Banks, Credit card providers and other organizations that extend credit to you all provide data to your credit report, other providers can be:

- Mobile phone providers
- Utility companies
- Broadband suppliers
- Insurance companies

The information includes the:

- Amount of credit granted to you
- Whether you make repayments on time
- The proportion of your bill that you repay each month.

## 3.1 The Compilation of Your Credit History

The agencies don’t have access to or explore, all your personal information, but they do examine the following:

- Have you a county court judgement (CCJ) or other court orders indicating you have a history of debt problems?
- Were you ever convicted of fraud?
- Have you ever been the victim of identity theft or fraud?
- Have you ever defaulted on a payment (when the information shows you didn’t pay but should have done)? — Are you still in default?
- How do you operate your bank and credit card accounts? e.g, do you pay off your credit card bill in full each month?
- Total recent applications for credit have you made? Does not matter if approved or rejected.
- Are you on the electoral register? This is one vital piece of non-financial information that will affect your ability to borrow money.

References agencies do not record the following:

- Your income or pension
- Declined applications
- Criminal records
- Details about your savings and investments
- Your medical records or time taken off work for sickness
- Your race, religion, ethnicity or any political affiliations
- Student loans — although defaults on payments can reflect on you
- Your record in making Council Tax payments on time
- The untimely payment of fines for driving and parking offences.

The lender will require the following details:

- Your age.
- Your employment category.
  - Confirmation of whether the job is permanent or a fixed-term contract.
  - May also have to disclose completion of a probationary period.
- Your salary.
- Your marital status.
- Any financial dependants you have, e.g. children.
- Your address.
- Whether your home is owner-occupied, rented, or whether you’re living in someone else’s home.

## 3.2 Boosting Creditworthiness

Check credit reports once a year at least. If the information held on the reports is incorrect, you could end up having applications for credit declined as a result of errors. Access the information on the reports of the ’Big 3’ agencies. There will be variations between the information held on you from each of the agencies. If there are errors, get them corrected.

Check your credit reports before any major applications and if you have an application for credit rejected. Having a rejection means you’ve applied, and each application puts a mark on your file. Lots of applications decrease a lender’s willingness to offer credit as it looks as though you’re overly reliant on it. Get errors corrected ASAP as they may mean you get continuously rejected, and you want to stop that spiral.

Make sure that you’re registered on the electoral roll or that you have proof of residency. Staying registered is vital because if you’re not on the roll, it’s unlikely that any institution will want to lend to you.

Check whether you’re linked to someone financially, as their credit score can affect yours. Being ’linked’ is about whether you have a joint financial product such as a joint bank account or mortgage. Being financially linked means that their history is also considered as part of assessing whether to accept you. If your partner or flatmate has a poor history, keep your finances separate. Once finances are no longer linked (break-up, moved homes), write to the credit reference agencies and ask for a notice of disassociation. You can also find the forms online.

## 3.3 Good Tips to Help Your Creditworthiness

Most of the key tips for managing and improving your credit score come down to ’good financial habits’:

- Repay on time, so they do not end up on the credit report.
- Don’t apply for lots of accounts in a short time,
  - Try to avoid any applications before something major, such as a mortgage application.
- Consider closing unused credit card accounts and cut up the cards.
  - The credit limits for these cards might limit your ability to borrow elsewhere.
  - Dispensing with cards you have used responsibly for a long period might lower your credit score, so they’re often best left open
  - Don’t max out the card limits.
- Try to manage your debts, focusing on the most expensive first, as this can help your credit score.
- Avoid payday loans.

Also, remember never to lie when making any applications for credit as, if detected, this could come back to haunt you.

# 4. Who Are the Lenders?

The financial services’ industry consists primarily of banks. They include the major ’high street’ names, such as Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, HSBC, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander. Smaller banks, like Metro Bank. Banks that do not have a branch network like First Direct, a subsidiary of HSBC. These banks deal with customers via the internet, post or phone.

Building societies are different. They’re ’mutual’ organizations, owned by their members — these are their savings and mortgages customers.

Finance companies are often subsidiaries of banks, building societies or large companies. They specialize in personal loans, and motor and retail finance.

Credit Unions are cooperative organizations, often small and run on a localized basis. They can be community-based, with members tending to come from low-income groups; or work-based, with members employed by the same employer or in the same industry. One of the largest is The Open University’s credit union.

The UK Government owns The Student Loans Company. It lends to students in higher education to enable them to meet their expenses. With the cost of higher education increasing in recent years, the Student Loans Company has become a major lender.

Then there’s the high-cost credit market aimed at people on low incomes. They provide high risk, unsecured lending to customers who have limited or no access to mainstream credit. As a reflection of this, the cost of credit’s steep. Such lenders include payday lenders.

Budgeting loans are available for people on some state benefits (or Budgeting Advances for people getting Universal Credit). You must pay this loan back; this method does not incur any interest.

The basic business model of all lenders is the same. It involves borrowing money from the public or wholesale markets and lending the money (at a profit) to people like you and me, to companies, local authorities and even governments.

# 5. Debt Products

Here’s a run-down of the most common forms of borrowing.

## 5.1.1 Overdrafts

An overdraft is a pre-agreed on limit that you can use when you have run out of money in your account. It takes your account into a negative balance if you use it. If you are £500 overdrawn, your account balance will show -£500. In all cases, the overdrawn amount will need resolving. Overdrafts can be expensive as the interest rates for being overdrawn can be up to 40%.

## 5.1.2 Credit Cards

A card that allows you to spend on, up to an agreed amount. It’s a debt that you must pay back. The billing cycle is monthly and you can choose to pay off the full amount or the smallest amount required by the card issuer. Choosing the latter incurs interest charges as you’re not paying the debt off in full. There may be some circumstances where charges for interest occur. e.g. withdrawals.

Some credit cards offer an attractive 0% interest rate for a limited period.

Store cards are a form of credit card used for buying from specified outlets. They tend to have much higher interest rates than credit cards.

## 5.1.3 Charge Cards

Close in behaviour to a credit card, the differences being:

- You can offset the debt by up to two months between purchases
- Each monthly cycle requires full repayment of the debt
- You may need to pay a fee to use the card

## 5.1.4 Loans

Loans made to individuals, typically with terms of between 1 and 10 years. They may be either unsecured or secured against an asset. Unsecured personal loans are not contractually linked to any assets the borrower buys. These are available from credit unions, banks, building societies, direct lenders and finance companies.

## 5.1.5 Hire Purchases (HP)

Attached to an asset such as a car, this is a form of secured debt and can typically be up to 10 years.

## 5.1.6 Mortgages

Another form of secured debt, it’s a loan to enable purchases of property or land. These can typically be for 25 to 30 years and some go up to 40 years. This longer you borrow for, the more interest you will end up paying.

## 5.1.7 Other (Expensive) Types of Credit

These loans should be a last resort as the charges are incredibly high.

- Doorstep lending or ’payday lending’.
- ’rent-to-own’, a high-cost means of purchasing household goods.
  - Marketed at people on lower incomes and/ or with poor credit histories. These have been subject to clampdowns by authorities over poor sales tactics.

## 5.1.8 Peer-To-Peer (P2P) Loans

This is an emerging form of lending where special websites link people who have money to invest with individuals or companies wanting to borrow, so you’re effectively borrowing from other individuals rather than a bank. The sites, such as Zopa and Ratesetter, profit by taking a fee.

## 5.1.9 Personal Contract Purchases (PCP)

This is a popular form of financing a car. The billing cycle is monthly for 2 to 3 years, after which you can make a one-off payment to own the car or trade it in for a new one (the latter starting a new PCP deal). You can also give the car back subject to ’wear-and-tear’ conditions of the contract.

To own the car, the dealer will expect you to pay off at the trade-in value after the finance agreement ends.

# 5.1.10 Student Loans

A loan that finances further and higher education studies. They are not like ordinary loans or other forms of credit. Debts are repayable when said student’s income exceeds the threshold for repayments. As of 2020/21, if your salary exceeds £26,575, you will start paying back your student loans.

- For an undergraduate course, any amount over the threshold incurs a 9% tax rate.
- For a postgraduate course (masters, doctorate), any amount over the threshold incurs a 6% tax rate.

# 6. How Much Does It Cost to Borrow Money?

When someone borrows money, the amount they have to repay to the lender consists of three elements.

1. The amount originally borrowed.

   - Often referred to as the principal sum or sometimes the capital sum.
   - Paid back in stages over the life of the loan.
     - Possible to pay it all back at the end and pay the interest monthly.

2. The interest incurred on that debt.

   - This is the key price you pay to be able to borrow, and how banks etc. make their money. It’s expressed as a percentage per year - i.e. 7% per annum.

   - On a constant £10,000 debt the cost at 7% is £700 per year. As you pay back a loan, the interest owed per year will diminish.

3. Charges.
   - Charges associated with taking out, having or repaying debt, which is common on mortgages.

## 6.1 Annual Percentage Rate (APR)

Borrowers must repay to the lender both the principal sum and the interest. It’s common to expect extra costs included on top of this:

- Arrangement fees
- Intermediary fees
- Early repayment fees

Given these different potential charges and the possible differences in the timing of repayments of borrowed money, it’s important to have a good means of comparing the total cost of debt on different debt products.

The Annual Percentage Rate (APR), is a way to create like-for-like comparisons and assess the appropriateness of a debt product.

- Takes into account the interest rate charged on money borrowed and also the frequency of the payments throughout each year
- Any other compulsory charges that are part of the contractual agreement are also considered.

While useful with loans and credit cards, APR as a comparator is not infallible. On mortgages, for instance, it assumes you stick with that mortgage provider for the full term and pay the standard variable rate when an introductory rate ends. The reality is people never pay that standard rate — as they tend to switch mortgage before it’s charged — so there is little to gain from comparing a mortgage cost over 20 years or more.

Note that APR does not include:

- Optional charges, such as buildings insurance
- ’contingent’ charges, such as early repayment charges

Generally, a low APR means lower costs for the borrower.

## 6.2 Setting Interest Rates and the Role of the Bank of England

The rate set by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), also known as ’Bank Rate’, is the rate at which the Bank of England will lend to the financial institutions. This determines the level of bank ’base rates’ — the lowest level at which the banks will lend money. The result is that the Bank Rate (also known as the ’official rate’) effectively sets the general level of interest rates for the economy as a whole.

The Bank of England’s MPC meets eight times a year to consider policy and set its Bank Rate in the light of economic conditions — in particular the prospects for price inflation (the rate of increase in the price of consumer products like groceries, clothing, household goods and fuel).

The MPC’s primary focus is to set interest rates at a consistent level, keeping price inflation at around 2% p.a.

- The MPC might increase interest rates to discourage people from taking on debt if the inflation rates rise above 2%.
- Conversely, they may lower interest rates to encourage people to spend and borrow more.

After 2013 this approach to setting the Bank Rate takes into greater account other measures of economic activity, like the level of unemployment.

One other factor to consider is the difference between price inflation and interest rates, referred to as the ’real’ interest rate. When interest rates are higher than price inflation, then real interest rates are positive. This is good news for savers who will see the purchasing power of their savings rising. When price inflation exceeds interest rates, then real interest rates are negative. This is bad news for savers who will see the purchasing power of their savings falling.

For anyone who is borrowing, the reverse applies — positive real interest rates are bad news, but negative real interest rates are good news.

# 7. Low Cost and High-Cost Borrowing

To emphasize the previous sections, some statements generally match the methods of borrowing (These are relative to the average cost of the six ways of borrowing):

- A. Low-cost interest rate
- B. High-cost interest rate if not on a promotional rate — e.g. 0% rate for an introductory period
- C. You risk having an asset (e.g. your home) repossessed if you don’t keep up repayments
- D. Can be interest-free for a time (e.g. introductory 0% rates for balance transfers)
- E. They can often get you price discount the first time you use them to buy goods in a shop
- F. If this facility has been pre-arranged, you can use it to borrow without having to notify your bank right away
- G. The lender will need a valuation of the asset you are buying before lending money
- H. You have discretion about what you spend the borrowed money on
- I. Borrowing in this way might impair your credit score

| Method of Borrowing | Features of Consequences (A — I) |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Mortgage            | A, C, G                          |
| Bank Loan           | A, F, H                          |
| Overdraft           | B, F, H                          |
| Credit Card         | B, D, H                          |
| Store Card          | B, E, H                          |
| Payday Loan         | B, H, I                          |
